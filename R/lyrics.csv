Overly Dedicated,Growing Apart (To Get Closer),2010,"chorus
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
(Smoke to it, nigga, smoke to it, nigga)
Where are we going? We should be slowing down
Where are you going? We should be growing now
verse
That′s what she said to me
That place I used to call home is just a bed to me
And we don't even sleep, neighbors can hear her weep
Meanwhile, I′m in these streets with everybody
I'm tryna get it and she know they got me
I watch her feelings watch me
As they staring with the saddest eyes of loneliness
Look each other in the face and barely blink
I tried to make it right, but the pen ran out of ink
So if my letters don't reach you, I hope these lyrics in sync
chorus
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
verse
That′s what it said to me
But the place I call ambition now dead to me
Gone and forgotten, I′m off track like Dale Earnhardt, my liver rotten
Alcoholic tripping, fucking bad bitches and they got bad intentions
Club night, guys and dolls
Balling out, but I'm ′bout to drop the ball
I'm calling out for help, my engineer called
Told me ""Come to the studio"", I wanna tell him ""Nah""
chorus
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
verse
That′s what he said to me
But that place we call Heaven unfair to me
Only 144 can go
Seven billion people on planet Earth today
Is there something that I don't know?
I know to follow Him rather following people
Or follow vanity ′cause that means I'm following evil
Guess, I'm following evil, I should follow cathedral
Blessings I need but live like I don′t need you
chorus
Where are we going? Why are we slowing down?
Where are you going? We should be growing now
verse
So in conclusion, we all seem to stumble, planning our own demise
Forgetting the big picture and making it wallet size
So to what′s important in my life, I apologize
I promise to stay faithful, focused and sanctified
We all get distracted, the question is would you bounce back or bounce backwards?
Would you not know how to act or take action? It's just a part of life
And if your vision′s impaired, you probably lose it all tonight
outro
I'm trying to visualize how to get it right, but my vision′s so blurry
Trying to slow it down, stay close to the ground, but we're always in a hurry, now
And if I could make this world spin a little slower, then I would
Then we could grow a little closer, I think we′re getting closer
I think we're getting closer
"
Overly Dedicated,Ignorance Is Bliss,2010,"intro
Lord forgive me
verse
Kill him where he stand and stand over him
Shake his hand, then jump back in that minivan
Double back to his block and blam
I ain′t backin' down for nothin′
I'ma back 'em down like Shaq
With this black 2-2-3 in my hand
Better pray that this chopper jam like a radio single, man
Police radio signals sayin′ that a 187 land on yo′ corner
Coroners comfort yo' momma
""Momma, he′s dead,"" the next mornin'
I toasted up with my homies
We drink and smoke marijuana
Want us to change our ways? Uh-huh
You see this game we play come from
Uncles that raised me in Compton
Ask me what I have accomplished
I don′t know, I don't have conscience
I just load up and start dumpin′ on enemies
I'm headhuntin', no sympathy
Ain′t no love when you in these streets
Just get somethin′, protect yo' neck
′Cause they comin' for sets, respect
Split your onion, then chop yo′ deck
Your head tumblin' like gymnastics (ooh...)
′Cause ignorance is bliss
chorus
Now everybody put yo' hands up high
If you don't give a fuck, put yo′ hands up high
This the hardest shit you′ve heard from L.A. this far
And I'm this far from a discharge, but never will I diss y′all
We all tryna ball, and when I got the rock, I'll dish off
Until the day I pistol-whip you posers ′til y'all pissed off
Then peel off in a hoopty
Come back and make these niggas wanna shoot me
verse
And they bitches wanna salute me or seduce me
Indubitably, I′m too street, indubitably, I'ma do me
Better than yo' bitch would, ′cause you niggas too weak
But just give me two weeks and I′m good
I'll make an album that′ll put a smile on Malcolm
Make Martin Luther tell God I'm the future for Heaven′s talent
No tarot card readin', I′m foreseein' you niggas vanish
Not only from the rap game, I'm includin′ the planet
Cats so watered-down, clowns can sink Titanic
Tie titanium around they neck and watch ′em panic
Gimme respect, dammit, or get damaged
Die young, corpse identified by your parents
Apparently, you're a parrot, mockin′ me and my blueprint
But I won't share it, just make you cop it, then call you a sheriff
Stop it, I′m hearin' the comments
The critics are callin′ me conscious
But truthfully, every shooter be callin' me Compton
So truthfully, only callin' me Kweli and Common?
Proves, that ignorance is bliss
chorus
Now everybody put yo′ hands up high
If you don′t give a fuck, put yo' hands up high
And this still the hardest shit you′ve heard from L.A. this far
And I'm this far, from a discharge, but never will I diss y′all
This my world, I grab the universe then play kickball
And they wonder why these California earthquakes hittin' so hard
verse
I′m So-Cal, you so-called rappers need to go call Ghostbusters
'Cause you busters are Casper when I go off
I show up to show out and show off
You a hundred percent behind me
And if you are, then wreck yo' car
And walk up to my crime scene
I remember bein′ 17, wishin′ someone would sign me
Now the only way these labels get me back is when they rewind me
Backin' down bargains, backin′ down bitches
We gon' flip her
Once she off that blue dolphin, you gon′ tip her
'Cause ignorance is bliss
outro
And Willie B, I′m a fool on yo' beats
I bleed out the speaker as the speaker that spoke when they didn't speak

Gina, baby, I don′t have no money and I don't have no ends

Oh, what up hoe? Oh, what up?

verse
Welcome to my diary, stressing got me gray hairs
Something to inspire me, rather than society′s
Woes, let me go, let me shine a lil' bit love
I want diamonds too, Ronnie on Player′s Club
I used to have a nine-to-five, fresh out of school, that was '05
That bitch was racist, got me fired, ever since then, I had no job
Pushing in my momma van, stop for gas on Rosecrans
Trust me these niggas rushed me for something my cousin probably did
Guilty by association story of my life, nigga
You gon′ make me flip and split yo' shit judge give me life, nigga
Pain since my grandma's death, Uncle killed at Louie′s Burgers
Hold my tears, I tried my best, let it go, drenched my pullover
Cycles of a starving artist tryna go beyond the margin, margin
Maintaining my modest modus as I dream
So while I go through all this, all this bullshit what you call it
Life itself I know it helps let me scroll through my BlackBerry
(Hey, what′s up, daddy?)
chorus
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that′s some great advice
I'm going through something with life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright (alright)
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright (alright)
Pussy and Patrón, that′s some great advice
bridge
So what'd you rush me out here for?
How was your day? Are you tipsy?
Mm-hm
hook
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patrón
Gimme that, once you gimme that, once again it′s on
Bitch, I'm swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw
Coming down clean, tell yo′ baby momma what it do?
Where yo′ friends at? I got long dick, what it is?
Go on poke it out, situate your lil' positives
How I live? Big shot, on my grind, all ready
I′ma lay it down like a carpenter, when you let me
verse
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can't get enough, if I offend you, blame it on the liquor babe
Gimme that funk, that sweet, that nasty, that gushy stuff
I can′t get enough, if I offend you
Uh, I wrote this song when Dave drove home
And caught that flat, in the mean T Flats
And it made me think, if we could blink
To change locations where we at
We often get lost in the alcohol bottle
In attempt to ignore pain, problem and sorrow
Just for a minute, then back to the bullshit
Your car note due and you 'bout to get evicted
Two drugs surely, Patrón, pussy, make it feel alright
But once it′s empty and the bitch leave, then it's back to life
You can't run from it, gotta run to it, nigga
The antidote wouldn′t last and you knew it, nigga
But still you proceed to dive deep, ask what′s her zodiac sign
chorus
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that′s some great advice
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that′s some great advice
verse
Okay, welcome to my diary, hmm, where should I begin?
Finna get a swisher and fill it with at least a gram
Crackers watch my every step, man, I hate to work for them
One time I tried to work for me, but that shit didn't work for me
And here I am, stressing, questioning my direction, man
What to do? Nothing′s moving, traffic jam, wiggle through it
Pop the cork and take the fluid, bust that pussy open
Bust that pussy open, bust that pussy open
(Soul) balls deep, ya dig? Retrieve, relief, ya dig?
Let's kill a bottle of tequila
And lie butt-naked telling the truth, would ya?
What's up? I had a long day and I really wanna fuck
Take a double shot to the face and forget about my whole day
′Cause all I′ve been thinking the whole day
chorus
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that′s some great advice
I'm going through something in life
But pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón make you feel alright
Pussy and Patrón, that′s some great advice
hook
All I need in this lifetime, pussy and Patrón
Gimme that, once you gimme that, once again it's on
Bitch, I′m swagged up, hoes bopping when I'm off that screw
Coming down clean, tell yo' baby momma what it do?

Kendrick Lamar
We hurt people that love us, love people that hurt us
Hurt people that love us, love people
I′m inspired, so get inspired
verse
Kendrick Lamar
And so he said, ""Why you gotta be so kind hearted?
Why you couldn't be a con artist? Why you couldn′t?
Why you couldn't be mischievous or just a lil' devious
The moment that we first started?
Why you never ask for nothing, just a lil′ time?
Why you let me use yours ′cause I'on′t got mines?
Why you always lift me up, when I'm completely giving up
And when niggas holla, ""What′s up?"" you give a dry response?
Why you giving me your last knowing you ain't got it?
Why you always buy me something when you going shopping?
Why you tell me that you love me? Why you always thinking of me?
Want my company rather than going club hopping?
Why you treating my momma like she your momma too?
Why you making promises that you′ll forever do?
Whatever just to make me happy, wanting us to have a family
These are exactly the reasons why I cheat on you"" (sometimes)

Sometimes I, sometimes I feel we share
Nothing in common, it ain't fair
But where do we seem to fall
Where do we seem to fall
Tender love and care, once upon a time
Once upon a time, we was there
verse
Kendrick Lamar
And so she said, ""Why you gotta be so mean to me?
Why you don't know what you mean to me?
Why you always playing games? Why I feel like you ashamed
Out in public curse me out and make a scenery?
Why you got other bitches rolling their eyes at me?
Why text messages popping up saying, ""Hi, Daddy""?
Why you treat me like I′m nothing? Why you always at a function?
I be wanting to go out but you don′t ever ask me
Why you slip and say her name when we having sex?
Why you always assuming that I still love my ex?
Every time we get into it, I'm the one that′s feeling stupid
You don't need me, you gon′ leave me, that's ya favorite threat
Why you never know how it feel to be lonely?
Why I feel I′m the last option after ya homies?
Why you always gotta know that I will never let you go
Even though you get violent and put your hands on me?"" (sometimes)

Lamont Carey
She says she loves me
She says she loves me
So she clings to me, even when I want to be left alone
But she's beautiful
Like sometimes when I have things on my mind, she′s the perfect person to listen
And she only gives advice, she says, when I give her a cue
She says she loves me
Like when I wake up in the morning, she′s sitting on the edge of the bed
With a plate of food, wanting to feed me
She says she needs me
She says she loves me
Or like when I'm stepping out of the shower, she′s standing there with the towel
Wanting to, wanting to dry me off
She says, she says she loves me
So instead of admitting that she has made another mistake
She stays with it
She says she loves me, and I don't know about love

so we passed her round and round
Your bitch texted me, wants it now
so I had to knock her down
Hurt her bouncin′ off my balls
Slingin dick up from the mouth
You let it slide, I hit home-runs
Clean her dugout 'til I′m done
I can be your number two and you can be her number one
Her pussy's crazy
Her pussy′s crazy
You fuck niggas
Everytime I'm in my city I be feelin′ like my shit don't stink
Used to clean my rolling chain with alcohol in the sink
Ridin' ′round with niggas that I grew up with since Mac-nair
Bumpin′ me against the world, Hello world, Kendrick here
And I'm too much for these niggas
I′m three much for these ho? s
I'm too much for these niggas
I′m three much for these ho's
I′m too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho's
Wayne told me that
and that′s just how it goes
Michael Jordan, bitch
That means I′m too much for these niggas
I'm three much for these ho′s
Wayne told me that
and that's just how it goes

Overly Dedicated,R.O.T.C (Interlude),2010,"intro
This is me thinking at 4:43 AM, June 6
verse
Sometimes I wanna say fuck rapping, I need money now
Like should I start trapping? If what I write down
Don′t collect this very moment then I'm on it, no question
In the streets my niggas is well connected, let′s see
Do I cop a pound of kush, Promethazine or push some E?
Oxycontin have me laying on soft cotton when I sleep?
This is deep as the abyss, I'm not just rhyming on the beat
I be in spots chopping the rocks like flintstone feet
This is me frustrated, battling my own evils
Finna saddle up that work, across Ohio in a Geo
Or should I sell my music .zip to buy your zip
And hope one day it flourish to a kilo, track record of a hustler
Rather records on the needle, making music
Clocking fast bank like a shot from Patrick Ewing
My nigga, what you doing on these corners with me?
""I thought you had a show?"" Well ma nigga I guess I didn't
I′m tryna get this dough and easy money sounds tempting
Especially when your homies pushing V8 engines
Twenty-two on twenty-sixes, Range Rovers rolling up
Three-fifty for an ounce of fire, I hope I got enough
This industry calling my bluff, I need a new solution
Curve-serving, know I might be in your store boosting
2-11′s with Mac-11's like fuck Hip Hop
Don′t wanna be Pun, don't wanna be B.I.G., don′t wanna be 'Pac
Just give me your funds, A.K.A. everything that you got
Or everything getting shot, for nothing
Leave you in shock, coughing up blood and mumbling
Watch, the plans of a young man sponsor
Moving grams like relocating your mom′s momma
Then expand to the Hoover dam, water
Sherm, contraband, they yearn for the butt-naked
Fuck a verse, verses get let off in thirty minutes, six seconds
I disperse to the world of unruly, where I put the mic down
And pick up a sack and a toolie, if you knew me
You'll know I always had a passion for riddle when writing
But lately I've been thinking ′bout taking chances to brighten
My future financially, so please don′t be mad at me
I gotta do what I gotta do, no shit
So I tell my nigga front me, let me put it on the strip
Then give it back when I think about the consequence, shit
There are times, when you need someone
I will be by your side
Oh darling, cause there is a light that shines
Special for you, and me yeah
I-take-I-take-take my chances-chances-chances
Before they pass, they pass, they pass
Pass me by, oh darling
You've got to look at the other side

One time
Reporting live
Compton, California
verse
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life?
Like you never get right? Sort of like a black sheep
Back down, backing ultra dreams like some bad sleep
Chasing for the wind but you never win the track meet
Oh what a cold world for a broke nigga--it′s bitter
And life's a bitch, don′t hit women so I bit her
I struck enough pain let her know I wasn't playin'
I was so sincere like Nas first name
In Belly, they tell me
It′s very difficult to see 25 and if I survive it′ll probably be with a celly
My opportunities are low because my brown complexion floats in the ghetto rather in some heels like Giuseppe's
They want me unemployed, until I hit the streets
Fulfilling voids of broke D-Boys sellin′ weed
Fuckin' up my prestige, till I live with the blues
BB King or the neighbors of Snoop
chorus
That′s why I'm in the club like fuck it, though
They say it′s only one life, life, life
And if you say I can't live comfortable
Ima tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
So while I hold this bottle of Ciroc with a hand full of ass
Celebrate the very day that I get past
Through the barbed wire
verse
Have you ever felt like, like you never get life
Like you never did right? Sort of like a black sheep
Tryna get away from the World stereotype
Barbed wire got a barricade on your destiny
She desperately in need of some inspiration, see what the people sayin′
She gon have a baby then flee from her education
At the age of 16, credit card scam schemes
See a scar on her eye, boyfriend brutality
She will never get by, no how no way
Where every recipient, property of the state
Housing, Section 8, corner store, prostitute
The owner bout to prosecute, the niggas tell her that she′s cute
Hood rat trashy, six baby daddies
And this baby daddy, is new to the family
Chillin' in pajamis, waitin′ on the first
Fast forward spillin' drinks on her fur
chorus
That′s why she in the club like fuck it, though
They say it's only one life, life, life
And if you say she can′t live comfortable
She tell you that's a lie, lie, lie
So while she up in VIP pourin' Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
We are, we are (fine!)
We are, we are (true!)
Through the, through our (wires)
We will, we′ll break (through!)
So while she in the VIP pourin′ Merlot in the glass
Celebrate the very day that she get past
Through the barbed wire
verse
Have you ever felt like, you finally got life
You finally got right? No longer a black sheep
Livin' off ya dreams like Christina uh-Milian in the front seat
Of a convertible elopin′ to get married
What a feeling of overcoming the odds
It's like I just hit the lottery, my God
There must be a God
Cuz golly, you done made it through the fight while squabbling Ali
Now ya lifestyles lookin′ up and you escaped the crooked cops and you ain't have to kill a nigga just to make a couple bucks
And she ain′t have to go and fuck on anybody for a dollar, making good decisions
Got an independent business mind
And both of ya'll are steady grindin, doin' it the legal way just tryna make a decent pay on every second of the day
But they won′t give you the credit, disses out they mouth
You must enter the Illuminati just to ball out
chorus
In the club like fuck it, though
They say it′s only one life, life, life
And if you say they can't live comfortable
They gon tell you that′s a lie, lie, lie
So even though you overcame doubt and ya livin' ain′t bad
Know there's a barbed wire that′s always in your past
Moving barbed wire

Overly Dedicated,Average Joe,2010,"intro
The hardest thing for me to do
Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That′s the hardest thing
verse
Who is K. Dot? A young nigga from Compton
On the curb writing raps next to a gun shot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
The fraudulent tender scars that get unveiled
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
With that being said, each one of their rivals
Was aiming something at my head, I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
And I don't even push a line, I′m just tryna push these rhymes
In the midst of staying neutral and discrete
My momma said you're judged by the company you keep
But what you can consider, that if it goes down
They'll kill you if you kill me, it gets deep nigga
So if you ask what I′m doing
I′m tryna duck the influence of my city that's that′s brewing, real talk, and
chorus
This is why they fuck with me (real talk nigga, believe it)
This is why they fuck with me (do what I do, you know?)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I′m just your average Joe (know that)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
verse
I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle rolled up, and I was like hol′ up
Where you from? ""I don't bang""
Where you stay? ""Westside"", that's a Piru gang to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Shots rang out, hoping to God I wasn′t wet
Crossed across Rosecrans and ran inside of the yet
Chirped the homies on the I-95 they said they already knew
What happened, and meet ′em outside the garage
Never seen that many guns in my life
I was paranoid like a fiend in the night, but needed revenge
Grabbed the nine-ball, opened up the door, then got in
Somebody said fall back
We gon' make these niggas suffer
You my brother like a frat, and that′s just to remind you
Thought about that so long I had failed my finals, fuck, but
chorus
This is why they fuck with me (I told you nigga)
This is why they fuck with me (you fake nigga)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I′m just your average Joe (you fake)
But one thing you should consider, I'm the realest you know
verse
I don′t do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
Give 'em cuts like a nigga pierced a knife through it
You say you through, but I′ve been through it, now that′s cold
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
Where the niggas drink Remy and hold semis for cutthroats
Bernie Mac died, it's no joke
Don′t ask why if you don't know about these killers and thieves
Seven grams of weed, you smoke that, but I′m high off life
I could fall out the sky like twice
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
'Cause it′s hotter than a lunatic's underarms in a straitjacket
In other words, we get it cracking, but I keep it cool, you know
chorus
This is why they fuck with me
This is why they fuck with me (real talk)
I'm no gangster, no killer, I′m just your average Joe (come on)
But one thing you should consider, I′m the realest you know

So there you have it
But I'ma leave you with this
An O.G. once told me
A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money
I′m gone

Everybody know I spit that other shit
Shit that make you duck for cover shit
Shit that make you hop out your seat and slap your mother shit
Especially when Drop drop the beat
I drop jewels like my nuts dropped out of my briefs
Jump in the booth and shatter every rapper′s dream
They jump in a sauna because I killed their self-esteem
That's a jab, you should bob and weave
Like Pam when Martin pulled jokes out his sleeve
I go in studio sessions and feel like a nerd
Cause I′m the only nigga there not smoking no herb
You telling me the kush make you think on level four?
I'm on five, you saying that I can level more?
In high school my teachers thought I was smoking stress
Didn't know my eyes low cause of genetic defects
I stimulate my mind every time I think about the end of time
Creation of man, and Columbine
chorus
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I′m off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don′t even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don′t even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don′t even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don′t even smoke, I don't even smoke

Look, nowadays everybody think they're big chiefers
Just cause they heard that new tape from Wiz Khalifa
Knowing damn well they can′t hit the sour
They′re new booties, they probably need baby powder
My skill shower over your city for 40 days
40 nights, off the chain, like freedom of slaves
Before you get it twisted, like 40 gays
My flow worth the earth, that's not to be appraised
Those the type of lines that I′m talking 'bout
You know the type of rhymes you don′t talk about
Copy my session on a disc when the session ends
So my momma can have it and play it for her friends
Brag on me, like ""My son's ′bout to win
Somehow, some day, and I don't care when""
I might hit the gin once a month
I'll let you in-hale, like an atheist
chorus
Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I′m off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don′t even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don′t even smoke, I don't even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo
But a sip of Henny is the farthest I would go
I don′t even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don′t even smoke, I don't even smoke
verse
I'll take you back to the 9th grade
When Dough Boy had me high for 4 days
That′s my nigga, he a street nigga
Probably in your hood, fucking up your street, nigga
But anyway I think it was some purple
Told me ""Don′t hit it hard because it'll hurt you""
I didn′t listen, I was floating like the Rose Parade
Swear to God a nigga seen some flying fishes
That was the Vegas trip, Hooters sponsored
The same time I start writing like a fucking monster
I'm Frankenstein every time this mothafucker ponders
Just underline every letter, capital K-D-O-T
Laying it flat out, like a tire with slow leaks
Now what you ′bout? Nothing huh
Am I a square cause I don't puff a square?
Are my raps too blunt to hit the blunt? Yeah

Bet you think that this some high shit that I wrote
Probably think I′m off the kush or the hydro
(Nope) I don't even smoke, I don't even smoke
I don′t even smoke, I don′t even smoke
I really appreciate that you share your Indo

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I′m tryna find myself, I'm searching deep for Kendrick Lamar
I read about Napoleon Hill and try to know God
They say he the key to my blessings, and if I speak the good
Into existence, that instant my dreams will unlock
Money flow like water, I'll just wait at the dock
And by the way I′ma start, finding more light to shed
Like a small garage in your backyard
I′m back chilling with a friend of mine, she mighty fine
But I notice that her heart resides next to bitterness
Always hollering who she don't like and who she kick it with
Who she wanna fight, who wearing a weave
Who Dooney and Bourke bag is fake, who holding the keys
To the car she drove last year or who fucking on who
And who need a pap smear, getting on my nerves
But before your negative energy curve, bitch I′ma cut you off

'Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah

Uh, I′m tryna learn something new
I'm tryna surround myself with people that inspire me
Or at least inquire similar desires
To do what it T-A-K-E just to reach the T-O-P
I′m talking ideas, motivation
It's more than making, enemies, my nigga
Oh, that's not ya memo? Then tell me why you constant stressing
On how you well connected like centipedes, my nigga
I function with you and you flaunt your pistol
Every second tell me how you pressed ′em at the Monte Cristo
Where so and so from, and what neighborhoods beefing
Who baby momma′s a rat, and who got killed last weekend
That shit is mad depressing, bringing me down
Speak on somethin' with some substance that can get us both paid
Rather than telling me how these niggas jocking your style
Or his rims ain′t bigger, pussy nigga, I'ma cut you off

′Cause every time you come around
You be hollering that whoop-de-whoop, blah-zay-blah

Uh, I'm tryna learn something new
I′m tryna better my chances of becoming a star
I'm tryna feel the vibe of Mona Lisa
Studying art, now paint that picture
Life behind bars, remember the very day I got caught?
I murdered a rapper, and you filed the police report?
See what I was taught, family is all I need
But indeed them too can run me right up a tree
Constantly talking shit 'bout the next relative
Wanting me to take sides, but I′d never give in
Ever since grandma died, everyone parted ways
Argue on holidays, left my uncle in prison
For 15 years, no one paid him attention but moms
Yeah, my momma as loyal as any sister would come
Come to my house just to yap about your own people
Dang, and if your blood wasn′t running through my veins
I would prolly cut y'all off too, yep

I was Your Highness, you was my queen
You got over him when I got in between
Watching Martin on TV as it was T-D-S
For us to eat TV dinners every time we was famished
But it was such a pleasure to watch you try to hold it together
Every time I put the head in you would panic
And come right down like an avalanche
Make your legs slant, whisper till you juicing up your pants
Baby how that sound? Kosher, no sir
Wake it back up, Folgers posters

My heart would go black, shrivel up and drop out
There we go again, what the fuck you talking bout?
We used to fuck all the time back at my momma's house
Smoking beedies, laying on the futon
Memories I got saved up like a coupon
And we′d be too gone off a sack of stress weed
I was broke then, couldn't count the best weed
Then she would just leave in a black hatchback
Homies from the hood used to ask me if I'd tapped that
I would say yep, smiling so freely
That was back then, but I bet she still need me

Stewardess complimenting me on my nappy hair

Eat my asparagus, then I′m asking her

A crash dummy for dollars, I know you dyin' to meet 'em

With my back against the wall and your bitch on the edge of my dick
Jump off
I call a bitch a bitch, a ho a ho, a woman a woman
I never did nothing but break the ground on top of the asphalt
Tire mark gave you evidence that
I′m easily peddling with the speed of a lightning bolt
As a kid I killed two adults, I'm too advanced
I lived my 20′s at two years old, the wiser man
Truth be told, I'm like 87
Wicked as 80 reverends in a pool of fire with devils holding hands
From the distance, don′t know which one is a Christian, damn
Who can I trust in 2012?
There's no one not even myself
A Gemini screaming for help, somebody

The King of diamonds wit′ diamonds I never do ask for
They checkin′ my passport, I'm too accustomed with customs
She call in the task force, I killed it, somebody cuff ′em
They want me to fast forward the game, and why you complain

Man, I swear my nigga trippin' off that shit again
Pick him up, then I set him in cold water
Then I order someone to bring him Vicodin
Hope that take the pain away
From the feeling that he feel today
You know when you part of Section .80
Feel like no one can relate
′Cause you are, you are, a loner, loner
Marijuana, endorphins, make you stronger, stronger
I'm in the house party trippin' off
My generation sippin′ cough syrup like it′s water
Never no pancakes in the kitchen
Man, not one our lives is caught up
In the daily superstition that the world is 'bout to end
Who gives a fuck? We never do listen
Unless it comes with an 808
(A melody and some hoes)
PlayStation and some drank
(Technology bumping soul)
Looking around and all I see
Is a big crowd, that′s product of me
And they probably relatives
Relevant for a rebel's dream
Yep, her president is black, she black too
Purple label on her back, but that tab is light blue
She take it straight to the head

And then she started feelin' herself
Like no one else in this apartment
Beg your pardon
Oh, I rap baby, how old are you?
She say 22, I say 23
Okay then, we all crack babies
Damn, why you say that?
She said, where my drink at?
I'ma tell you later, just tell your neighbors
And the police relax
I stood up, shut the blinds
Closed the screen, jumbotron
Made to the back, where she reside
Then she said, read between the lines
Yep, hope that I get close enough
When the lights turn down
And the fact that she just might open up
When the Nuvo start to drown her body
And I, know the both of us really deep in the mood now
It′s nothing we can do now
Somebody walked in with a pound
Of that Bay Area kush
She looked at me then looked, at it
Then she grabbed it
Then she said, get it understood
You know why we crack babies
Because we born in the 80s
That A.D.H.D crazy

Not rich, but wealthy
There's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back
And for that I give them my torso
You think about it
And don′t call me lyrical
'Cause really I′m just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words
To make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me

On ""Wanna Be Heard"" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved

You know what I′m talking 'bout?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That′s the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth

If it feel good to you, holler if you hear me
verse
You like to mistake a street nigga for real nigga
The same nigga that kill with ya will squeal with ya
I like to start it out from the bottom and build with ya
Be on my last dollar and split the bill with ya
I′m 23 with morals and plans of living cordial
Not rich, but wealthy
There's nothing you can tell me
My killings are not remorseful
The city got my back
And for that I give them my torso
You think about it
And don′t call me lyrical
'Cause really I′m just a nigga that's evil and spiritual
I know some rappers using big words
To make their similes curve
My simplest shit be more pivotal
I penetrate the hearts of good kids and criminals
Worrisome individuals that live life critical
So won't you bear witness while I bare feet
So you can walk in my shoes and get to know me
But anyway, this for my pops
On his lunch break eating in that parking lot
On ""Wanna Be Heard"" probably thought he worked my nerves
But really he was stressing me getting what I deserved
Somebody said my name on the radio
He ain′t know I was ready for the world that minute
So the next time he roll up and drop grams in it
He′ll probably be out of work, laid back, while he-

Church is definitely on the move
And now we done took it up to the cathedral
′Cause the ""ism"" is enormous
You know what I'm talking ′bout?
We out here rotating under the five P's
Proper preparation prevents poor performance
You know what I′m talking 'bout?
Doing my thing
'Cause I′m rotating with my speakers thumping
From the Windy City streets
All the way out here to the streets of Compton
Know what I′m talking 'bout?
Church is definitely on the move
And we gonna continue to hustle and grow
And develop by fire
As I rotate with my true player partner
By the name of Kendrick Lamar
You know what I′m talking 'bout?
This is the ism, this is the vision
You know what I′m talking 'bout?
You gotta get up off your ass and get it, man
That′s the only way your pockets gonna expand
I tell you everyday, you know what I'm talking 'bout?
Apply yourself to supply your wealth
Only limitations you′ll ever have
Are those that you place upon yourself
Church is definitely on the move
You know what I′m talking 'bout?
Exercise your ""ism""
And don′t depend on no one else
Cathedral, church, ""ism""

On Long Beach Blvd
Flagging down
All of these flashy cars
verse
Kendrick Lamar
And Lord knows she′s beautiful
Lord knows the usuals
Leaving her body sore
She take the little change she make
To fix her nail cuticles, lipstick is suitable
To make you fiend for more
She play Mr. Shakur
That's her favorite rapper
Bumping ""Brenda′s Got A Baby""
While a pervert yelling at her
And she capture features of a woman
But only 17 and 7 cars start honkin'
She start running like FLo-Jo
Don't care if they Joe Blow
If they got money to blow a blow job is a sure go
And sure enough don′t see a dime of dirty dollars
She givin′ all to her daddy but she don't know her father, that′s ironic
See a block away from Lueders park, I seen the El Camino parked
In her heart she hate it there, but in her mind she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Rosa Parks never a factor when she making ends meet

verse
Kendrick Lamar
And Lord knows she's beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
Her anatomy is God′s temple, and it's quite simple
Her castle is about to be destroyed, she′s always paranoid
Watching the law inside the streets undercovers the dummies that look like decoys
Remember, sergeant let her slide, said if he seen
What's between her thighs he'd compromise, to no surprise
She took the ultimatum around the alleyway and gave him
A warm welcome to fill him right below the navel
Though he was wired up like a pair of jumping cables
His eyes was closed shut, prior charges, he had waved em
It was a block away from Lueders Park, I seen a squad car parked
And in her heart, she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
Cause Rosa Parks never a factor when she topping off police

verse
Ashtro Bot
And Lord knows she′s beautiful
Lord knows the usuals, leaving a body sore
As she bust down like a 12 bunk on tour
She suddenly realized she′ll never escape the allure
Of the black man, white man, needed satisfaction at first
It became a practice, but now she's numb to it
Sometimes she wonder if she can do it like nuns do it
But she never heard of Catholic religion or sinners′ redemption
That sounds foolish, and you can blame it on her mother
For letting her boyfriend slide candy under her cover
Ten months before she was ten he moved in and that's when he touched her
This motherfucka is the fucking reason why Keisha rushing through that
Block away from Lueders park, I seen a El Camino park
And in her heart she hate it there but in her mind, she made it where
Nothing really matters, so she hit the back seat
And caught a knife inside the bladder, left her dead, raped in the street

(He dead), I killed him (amen), bitch

And this is rigor mortis, and it's gorgeous when you die
Ali recorded, and I'm Morpheus, the matrix of my mind
I′m out the orbit, you an orphan and a hairdresser combined
I′m on the toilet when I rhyme, if you the shit, then I decline
I climax where you begin, and then I end on cloud nine
And that's important when you morph into an angel in the sky
And don′t be forging all my signatures, my listeners reply
And tell me that you biting style, you got a hell of an appetite
And I'ma be here for a while, just buckle up before the ride
Or knuckle up if you can fight, we always making ′em duck or die
A suit and tie is suitable and usual in suicide
CSI just might investigate this fucking parasite

That's what they telling me
Aim it at your celebrity, this is studio felony
Ferragami so many and cool enough for the ′70s
Nigga, payback's a bitch, and bitch, you been livin' in debt with me
Dead ′em all and especially
Leave a call on his mother voicemail that say that he rest in peace
Bigger chopper the recipe
Wrestling? That′s irrelevant, rather rest at your residence
Whistling to the melody, couldn't think of a better D
Better be on your P and Q, it′s just me, Jay Rock, Soul, and Q
Solar system and barbecue, nothing else you can do

I wrapped him and made him Casper, I capture the likes of NASA
My pedigree to fly past ya, I′ll pass the weed to the pastor
We all are sinners, won′t you send us to Bible study faster?
Your hypocritist reaction a blasphemy, I assassin my casualty
And it's casually done, and tell ′em my salary come
In lump sum one hundreds, don't talk to me ′bout no money
The sun is under my feet, and I come in peace to compete
I don't run if you′d rather leap, my statistics go up in weeks
And I go visit the nearest creek, and I get busy on many MC
Really ballistic, anybody can see
Any assistance, everybody deceased
Some persistence, recognize I be
Really too vicious, the permanent beast
And the demolition breaking up the street
Better partition, better dot your T
And I gon' mention how the far you see
Putting my dick in the rap industry
Everybody bitching, getting mad at me
Recognize Kendrick in the battery
And I'm charged up, and the catastrophe
Is charged up, and the audacity
Of y′all fucks never could hassle me
And y′all luck just ran out, you'll see

Look at my life, then look at yours
Get some ambition, why you bored?

Smoking out, pouring up, keep that lean up in my cup
All my car got leather and wood, in my hood we call it buck
Everybody wanna ball, holla at broads at the mall

Now everybody sing this shit

What′s your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Fire in the street, fire in the swisher
Fire in between the two legs of your little sister
Just get us and put us in elixir
Before they crop us out of the picture
I've never seen a crop circle
But I′ve seen a cop circled the block
I puff squares, but I swear one day I'm a stop my nerves itch
On the brink of my career
While my peers struggle for employment
Can you hear these screams (Uncle Sam ain't no killing me)
One two, three four grams and a fifth of Hennessey
A bad bitch, fuck the penitentiary
Such an eighties baby, blame Ronald Reagan, we raising hell
Lord forbid
The homie got wet, so we trying to soak it in
The president is black, but you can′t vote for skin
You vote for the better man
Come to our show you can see the diversity
Unified people they going to peep universally
We might not change the world
But we going to manipulate it
Hope you participating
Ayo Dot, won′t you let these cats know
We knew we'd be here, like back in 04′
Started hiiipower because our generation
Needed a generator and a system, meant to disintegrate us
And all we do is assist them
When kicked verbs with victims
The bigger picture hasn't developed yet
Like what if kids were celibate
What if Tammy came across a real man
Who didn′t play games like child-ren
My nigga cheated on his girlfriend with his girlfriend's girlfriend
Let the world end
And everybody tripping off 2012
And the extraterrestrial presence as well (Odd Future′s odd)
But our future is not, that Martial law shit dropped
We gonna all get got
So keep that question mark on your face
Eat that fast food, and use that flouride toothpaste
Hide your feelings from the public
Work a long nine to five, don't forget to pay your tithes
And to thank God you're alive (Hiiipower)
And on another note
We focused like the Hubble Telescope, Soul
Life is a traffic jam (Life is a traffic jam)

What's your life about, enlighten me
Is you gonna live on your knees, or die on your feet
Is you gonna plead the fifth, or sound the horn
The time is now child, come on
See a lot of ya′ll don't understand Kendrick Lamar
Because you wonder how I could talk about money, hoes, clothes, god, history all in the same sentence
You know what all the things have in common
Only half of the truth, if you tell it
See I′ve spent twenty three years on the earth searching for answers
Til' one day I realized I had to come up with my own
I′ve not on the outside looking in
I'm not on the inside looking out
I'm in the death fucking center, looking around
You′ve ever seen a newborn baby kill a grown man
That′s an analogy for the way the world make me react
My innocence been dead
So the next time I talk about money, hoes, clothes, god, history all in the same sentence
Just know I meant it, and you felt it
Because you too are searching for answers
I'm not the next pop star

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
Malcolm X put a hex on my future someone catch me
I′m falling victim to a revolutionary song
The Serengeti's clone
Back to put you backstabbers back on your spinal bone
You slipped your disc when I slipped you my disc
You wanted to diss but jumped on my dick
Grown men should never bite they tongue
Unless you eating pussy that smell like it′s a stale plum
I got my finger on the motherfucking pistol
Aiming it at a pig, Charlotte's Web is gonna miss you
My issue isn't televised and you ain′t gotta tell the wise
How to stay on beat, because our life′s an instrumental
This is physical and mental, I won't sugar coat it
You′d die from diabetes if these other niggas wrote it
And everything on TV just a figment of imagination
I don't want no plastic nation, dread that like a Haitian
While you motherfuckers waiting
I be off the slave ship, building pyramids, writing my own hieroglyphs
chorus
Just call this shit HiiiPoWeR
Nigga, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches
I mean this shit is Huey Newton going stupid
You can′t resist his HiiiPoWeR
Throw your hands up for HiiiPoWeR

Visions of Martin Luther staring at me
If I see it how he seen it
That would make my parents happy
Sorry mama, I can't turn the other cheek
They wanna knock me off the edge
Like a fucking widow′s peak, uh
And she always told me pray for the weak, uh
Them demons got me, I ain't prayed in some weeks, uh
Dear Lord, come and save me, the devil's working hard
He probably clocking double shifts on all of his jobs
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, I need a license to kill
I′m standing on a field full of landmines
Doing the moonwalk hoping I blow up in time
′Cause 2012 might not be a fucking legend
Tryna be a fucking legend
The man of mankind
Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
So get up off that slave ship
Build your own pyramids, write your own hieroglyphs
chorus
Just call this shit HiiiPoWeR

I mean this shit is Bobby Seale making meals

Every day we fight the system just to make our way
We′ve been down for too long, but that's alright

(Never liked the system)
We′ve been down for too long, but that's all right, na-na-na

Who said a black man in the Illuminati?
Last time I checked, that was the biggest racist party
Last time I checked we was racing with Marcus Garvey
On the freeway to Africa 'til I wreck my Audi
And I want everybody to view my autopsy
So you can see exactly where the government had shot me
No conspiracy my fate is inevitable
They play musical chairs, once I′m on that pedestal
Frightening, so fucking frightening
Enough to drive a man insane, a woman insane
The reason Lauryn Hill don′t sing or Kurt Cobain
Loaded that clip and then said bang
The drama it bring is crazy
Product of the late 80's
Tryna stay above water, that′s why we shun the navy
Pull your guns and play me
Let's set it off, ′cause a riot, thow a Molotov
Somebody told me them pirates had got lost
'Cause we′ve been off slave ships
Got our own pyramids, write our own hieroglyphs
chorus
Just call this shit HiiiPoWeR
Yeah, nothing less than HiiiPoWeR
Five-star dishes, food for thought, bitches

Lord God, I come to you a sinner
And I humbly repent for my sins
I believe that Jesus is Lord
I believe that You raised him from the dead
I would ask that Jesus come to my life
And be my Lord and Savior

And that I may live for him from this day forth
Thank you, Lord Jesus, for saving me with your precious blood
In Jesus′ name, amen
verse
I met her at this house party on El Segundo and Central
She had the credentials of strippers in Atlanta
Ass came with a hump, from the jump she was a camel
I want to ride like Arabians, push an '04 Mercedes-Benz
""Hello, my name is Kendrick,"" she said, ""No, you′re handsome""
Whispered in my ear, disappeared, then found her dancin'
Ciara had played in the background
The parade music we made had us all wearin' shades now, cool
""Where you stay?"" She said, ""Down the street from Dominguez High""
Okay, I know that′s borderline Compton or Paramount
""Well, is it Compton?"" ""No,"" she replied
Then quickly start battin′ her eyes
I strictly had wanted her thighs around me
17 with nothin', but pussy stuck on my mental
My motive was rather sinful, ""What you tryna get into?""
She didn′t tell, just gave me her Nextel
Dropped the number, we chirped the whole summer, and, well
The summer had passed, and now I'm likin′ her
Conversation we havin' probably enticin′ her
Who can imagine? Maybe my actions'll end up wifin' her
Love or lust, regardless, we′ll fuck ′cause the trife in us
It's deep-rooted, the music of bein′ young and dumb
Is never muted, in fact, it's much louder where I′m from
We know a lot 'bout each other, her mother was a crack addict
She live with her granny and her younger two brothers
Her favorite cousin Demetrius is irrepetible
Family history of gangbangin′ did make me skeptical
But not enough to stop me from gettin' a nut
""I wanna come over, what's up?""
That′s what I told her soon as this episode
Of Martin go off, I′m tryna get off
I was in heat like a cactus
My tactics of bein' thirsty probably could hurt me
But fuck it, I got some heart
Grabbed my mama keys, hopped in the car, then, oh boy
So now I′m down Rosecrans in a Caravan
Passin' Alameda, my gas meter in need of a pump
I got enough to get me through the traffic jam
At least I hope, ′cause my pockets broke as a promise, man
I'm thinkin′ 'bout that sex
Thinkin' ′bout her thighs or maybe kissin′ on her neck or maybe what position's next
Sent a picture of her titties, blowin′ up my texts
I looked at 'em and almost ran my front bumper into Corvette
Enthused by the touch of a woman, she′s a masseuse
And I'm a professional pornstar when off the Goose
I had a fifth in the trunk like Curtis Jackson for ransom
I′m hopin' to get her loose like an Uncle Luke anthem
I'm two blocks away, two hundred and fifty feet
And six steps from where she stay, she wavin′ me ′cross the street
I pulled up, a smile on my face, and then I see
Two niggas, two black hoodies, I froze as my phone rang
outro
Please leave your message for three-two-three

You on your way or what?
I hope you ain't out there messin' with them damn hoodrats out there, shit

And plus you got school tomorrow
You keep fuckin' around in them streets, you ain′t gon' pass to the next grade
11th grade (is that Kendrick on the phone?)

He want to holler at you too, go ahead, Kenny, go'n, shit
Hello? Yak, where my motherfuckin′ dominoes at? (Kenny), What?
I'm on his voicemail, damn fool (oh), shit
Yak, where my motherfuckin' dominoes at?
This the second time I asked you to bring my fuckin′ dominoes
Just give me the damn phone, shit, don′t hang up, damn, let me (keep losin' my goddamn dominoes)

Smokin' on the finest dope, ay-ay-ay-ay
Drank until I can′t no more, ay-ay-ay-ay
Really I'm a sober soul
But I'm with the homies right now
And we ain′t askin′ for no favors
Rush a nigga quick, then laugh about it later, ay-ay-ay-ay
Really, I'm a peacemaker
But I′m with the homies right now

Me and my niggas four deep in a white Toyota
A quarter tank of gas, one pistol, an orange soda
Janky stash box when the federales′ll roll up
Basketball shorts with the Gonzales Park odor
We on the mission for bad bitches and trouble
I hope the universe love you today
'Cause the energy we bringin′ sure to carry away

Come through and bust ya head, nigga!

And if nutrition can help me
I'll tell you to suck my dick, then I′ll continue eatin'
We speedin′ on the 405, passin' Westchester
You know, the light-skinned girls in all the little dresses
Good Lord, they knew we weren′t from 'round there
'Cause every time we down there
We pullin′ out the Boost Mobile SIM cards
Bougie bitches with no extensions
Hood niggas with bad intentions, the perfect combination
Before we sparked a conversation
We seen three niggas in colors we didn′t like, then started interrogatin'
I never was a gangbanger, I mean
I never was stranger to the fonk neither, I really doubt it
Rush a nigga quick and then we laugh about it
That′s ironic, 'cause I′ve never been violent
Until I'm with the homies
(Just ridin′, just ridin')
Me and the homies
(Bullshittin', actin′ a fool)
Me and the homies
(Trippin′, really trippin')
Me and the homies
(Just ridin′, just ridin', just ridin′)
Braggin' ′bout the episode we just had
A shot of Hennessy didn't make me feel that bad
I'm usually a true firm believer of bad karma
Consequences from evil will make your past haunt ya
We tryna conquer the city with disobedience
Quick to turn it up, even if we ain′t got the CD in
But Jeezy still playin′, and our attitude is still ""nigga, what is you sayin'?""
Pull in front of the house that we been campin′ out for like two months
The sun is goin' down as we take whatever we want
bridge
Ay, ay, nigga, jackpot, nigga, pop the safe!
Ay, nigga, I think there′s somebody in this room!
Wait, what?!
Nigga, there's somebody in this room!
verse
I hit the back window in search of any Nintendo
DVD′s, plasma-screen TV's in the trunk
We made a right, then made a left, then made a right
Then made a left, we was just circlin' life
My mama called, ""Hello? What you doin′?"" ""Kickin′ it""
I shoulda told her I'm probably ′bout to catch my first offense with the homies
But, they made a right, then made a left
Then made a right, then another right
One lucky night with the homies

K. Dot, you faded, hood?
Yeah, we finally got that nigga faded
I think he hit the wrong blunt though (ooh, which one?)
Well, which one he talkin' about?
I was finna hit the one with the shenanigans in it
I pray he ain′t hit that
Nah, that nigga straight, he ain't hit that one
Got the shenanigans? Give that nigga the shenanigans!
Nigga, I think we should push back to the city, for real tho
Nigga, for what?
What that nigga, what′s that Jeezy song say, nigga?
""Last time I checked, I was the man on these streets!""
Yeah, yeah, that shit right there, I'm tryna be the nigga in the street
There he go (man, you don't even know how the shit go)
Alright, here′s the plan, luv
We gon′ use the kickback as an alibi, wait 'til the sun go down
Roll out, complete the mission, drop K. Dot off at his mama van at the park
′Cause I know he tryna fuck on Sherane tonight (that's what he′s not gon' do)
Then we all gon′ meet back at the block at about 10:30
That's straight, but we should just meet up around 12, I'm tryna fuck on somethin′ too
Nigga, sit yo dumb-ass back down (nigga, you ain′t doin' shit tonight)
Matter of fact, nigga, get in the motherfuckin′ car!
We finna get active!

And I know your taste is a little bit, mmm, high maintenance, uh
Everybody else basic, you live life on an everyday basis

If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You′re in the mood for empathy, there′s blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em?
I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off
Fuck that, pour up plenty of champagne
Cold nights when you curse this name
You called up your girlfriends and y′all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that

I was tryna put you on game, put you on a plane
Take you and your momma to the motherland
I could do it, maybe one day
When you figure out you're gonna need someone
When you figure out it′s alright here in the city
And you don't run from where we come from
That sound like poetic justice, poetic justice
You were so new to this life, but goddamn, you got adjusted
I mean, I write poems in these songs, dedicated to the fun sex
Your natural hair and your soft skin and your big ass in that sundress, ooh
Good God, what you doin′ that walk for?
When I see that thing move, I just wish we would fight less and we would talk more
They say communication save relations, I can tell

Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin′ in the mirror
Love is not just a verb, it's you lookin′ for it, maybe
Call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it′s coherent, I can hear it, mm-hmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mm-hmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines

Look inside these walls
And you see I′m havin' withdrawals of a prisoner on his way
Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray
Track attire just tell you I′m tired and ran away
I should ask a choir, ""What do you require
To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?""
As the record spin, I should pray
For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey
I got ate alive yesterday
I got animosity buildin', it′s probably big as a buildin′
Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin′ it safe
But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue
And you understand that I ain′t?
But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble
And live in the street with rank
No better picture to paint than me walkin′ from Bible study
And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face
From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang
Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks
I don't mind ′cause one day you′ll respect the good kid, m.A.A.d city

Finding me by myself, promise me you can help
In all honesty, I got time to be copacetic until
You had finally made decision to hold me against my will
It was like a head-on collision that folded me standing still
I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill
Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill
All my innocence while ignoring my purpose to persevere as a better person
I know you heard this and probably in fear
But what am I 'posed to do with the blinking of red and blue?
Flash from the top of your roof, and your dog has to say, ""Woof""
And you ask, ""Lift up your shirt,"" ′cause you wonder if a tattoo
Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through
Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile
I heard them chatter, ""He′s probably young, but I know that he's down""
Step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest
He don′t mind, he know we'll never respect the good kid, m.A.A.d. city

It′s entirely stressful upon my brain
You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change
When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain
The silence in this room with 20s, Xannies, and ′shrooms
Some grown-up candy, I lost it, I feel it's nothing to lose
The streets sure to release the worst side of my best

Brace yourself, I′ll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slinging crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighing on your brain
It was me, L Boogs and Yan Yan, YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, waving your hand out the window, check yourself, uh
Warriors and Conans, hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where - hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder saying that he did it
But ever since that day, I was looking at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the .9
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time

Suck a dick or die or sucker punch, a wall of bullets coming from

You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck your truce
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain′t no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies
IVs on top of IVs
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you′re corporate, or they'll be calling your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes except

Real simple and plain
Let me teach you some lessons about the street
(Smoke somethin' nigga), hood (sup cuz?)
It ain′t nothin' but a Compton thang, G-yeah, how we do
Fresh outta school ′cause I was a high school grad
Sleepin' in the living room in my momma's pad
Reality struck, I seen the white car crash
Hit the light pole, two niggas hopped out on foot and dashed
My Pops said I needed a job, I thought I believed him
Security guard for a month and ended up leaving
In fact, I got fired ′cause I was inspired by all of my friends
To stage a robbery the third Saturday I clocked in
Projects tore up, gang signs get thrown up
Cocaine laced in marijuana
And they wonder why I rarely smoke now
Imagine if your first blunt had you foaming at the mouth
I was straight tweaking, the next weekend, we broke even
I made allegiance that made a promise to see you bleeding
You know the reasons but still won′t ever know my life
Kendrick, a.k.a. Compton's Human Sacrifice
G-yeah, cocaine, weed
Niggas been mixin′ shit since the 80s, loc
Sherm sticks, butt nakeds, dip, make a nigga flip
Cluck heads all up and down the block and shit
One time's crooked and shit, block a nigga in
Alondra, Rosecrans, Bullis, it′s Compton
I'm still in the hood, loc, G-yeah, that′s cool (G-yeah)
The hood took me under so I follow the rules
But G-yeah, that's like me, I grew up in the hood where they bang
And niggas that rep' colors is doing the same thing
Pass it to the left so I can smoke on me
A couple drive-by′s in the hood lately (G-yeah)
Couple of IVs with the fucking spray-can
Shots in the crowd then everybody ran
Crew I′m finna slay, the street life I crave
Shots hit the enemy, hearts turn brave
Mount up, regulators in the whip
Down the boulevard with the pistol grip (G-yeah)
Trip, we in the hood still
So loc, grab a strap 'cause G-yeah, it′s so real (G-yeah)
Deal with the outcome, a strap in the hand
And a bird and ten grands where a motherfucker stand
If I told you I killed a nigga at sixteen
Would you believe me?
Or see me to be innocent Kendrick you seen in the street
With a basketball and some Now and Laters to eat?
If I mentioned all of my skeletons
Would you jump in the seat?
Would you say my intelligence now is great relief?
And it's safe to say that our next generation maybe can sleep
With dreams of being a lawyer or doctor
Instead of boy with a chopper
That hold the cul-de-sac hostage
Kill ′em all if they gossip
The Children of the Corn, they vandalizing
The option of living a lie, drown their body with toxins
Constantly drinking and drive
Hit the powder then watch this flame
That arrive in his eye, listen coward, the concept is aim
And they bang it and slide out that bitch with deposits
A price on his head, the tithes probably go to the projects
I live inside the belly of the rough

Fall right in -′s lap

And I hope that bitch that set him up out there

Aha, got them niggas, K-Dot, you good?

Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I′d call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow, I'm hoping that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I′m behind on what′s really important
My mind is really distorted, I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction or a reaction
Of what we consider madness, I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright and a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck had went against his will
As blood spilled on your hands, my plans rather vindictive
Everybody′s a victim in my eyes
When I ride, it's a murderous rhythm and outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back whispering, ""Get ′em""
I got 'em, and I ain′t give a fuck
That same mentality that told my brother not to duck
In actuality, it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a young′n in pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs
Dumb niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I′m proud and well devoted
This piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'mma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you ′cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
And if I die before your album drop, I hope (gunshots)
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it′s my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80, the message resembled ""Brenda's Got a Baby""
What′s crazy was, I was hearing about it
But doubted your ignorance how could you ever just put her on blast and shit
Judging her past and shit, well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now asking for ass and shit
And I'mma need that forty dollars even if I gotta
Fuck, suck and swallow in the parking lot
Gonzales Park, I′m followed by a married man, a father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinkling keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite ′cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss ′em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em back
To where they used to be then I′ll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that′s how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that ""Sorry for your loss"" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you trying to gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in? I′ll wait
Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I′m not in the song
'Cause I don′t need the attention bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I′m straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I′ll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I′mma get it or die trying
I′m eyeing every male gender with intentions of buying
You lying to these motherfuckers, talking about you can help 'em
With my story, you can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don′t ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga...

I said when the lights shut off
And it′s my turn to settle down
My main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in a mirror and ask myself:
Am I really scared of passing away? If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the holy ghost ′til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that make sure that my lifeline
Reeking the scent of a reaper, ensuring that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb help my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot, and every day the glass mirror
Get tougher to watch; I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I′m infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, ′cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I′m a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wondering when I'mma rest
And you′re right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak of something that′s realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't trying to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like, ""It need to be told""
Cursing the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain′t continued rappin′
Or steady being distracted by money drugs and four-
Fives, I count lives all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day, you'll be strong
Fighting for your rights even when you′re wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it?
Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off
And it′s my turn to settle down

Tired of running, tired of hunting
My own kind but retiring nothing
Tires are steady screeching, the driver is rubbing
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin′ her
Strayed bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waiting patiently but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is looking
It′s hard to channel your energy when you know you're crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I′m like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
How many sins? I′m running out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of balling like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper calling, I′m cottonmouth
Money is power (money is power)
Yours is ours (yours is ours)
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst
What are we doing? Who are we fooling?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of running, choirs is hummin′
Tell us to visit, we lying 'bout comin′
Now back to business, loading the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feuding, and the beef is bubblin'
It′s no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dying of thirst, dying of thirst, dying of thirst
Too many sins, I'm running out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See, all I know, is taking notes
On taking this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, are stress days
(Lord, forgive me for all my sins for I not know...)
My best days, are stress days
Say ""Fuck the world,"" my sex slave
Money, pussy and greed; what's my next crave
Whatever it is, know it′s my next grave
Tired of running, tired of running
Tired of tumbling, tired of running
Tired of tumbling
Back once my momma say
""See a pastor, give me a promise
What if today was the rapture, and you completely tarnished
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dying of thirst, you dying of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works""
Fuck! I′m tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin′ runnin', I′m tired of this shit! That's my brother, homie!
(""Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?)
I know that′s not what I think that is
Why are you so angry? See you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means? That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of The Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me

Your eyes never lie even if they tell
Sweet lullabies that come with a smell
Of a dozen roses flippin' down the green hill
You living in a world that come with plan B
′Cause plan A never relay a guarantee
And plan C never could say just what it was
And your plans only can pan around love
You love him, you love them, you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love red bottom and gold that say ""Queen""
You love handbag on the waist of your jean
You love French tip and trip that pay for
You love bank slip that tell you we paid more
You love a good hand whenever the card dealt
But what love got to do with it when you don′t love yourself?

And you can't see success coming from plan C
When it all breaks, you′ll still say you′re lovely
And love them and love when you love her
You love so much, you love when love hurts
You love fast cars and dead presidents old
You love fast women, you love keepin' control

You love your hood, might even love it to death

The reason why I know you very well
'Cause we have the same eyes, can′t you tell?
The days I tried to cover up and conceal
My pride, it only made it harder for me to deal
When living in a world that come with plan B
A scapegoat cause plan A don′t come free
And plan C just an excuse like ""because""
Or the word ""but,"" but what if I got love?
I love them, I love when I love her
I love so much, I love when love hurts
I love first verse 'cause you′re the girl I attract
I love second verse 'cause you′re the homie that pack
Burner like a stove top, that love cooking from scratch
I love what the both of you have to offer
In fact, I love it so much, I don't love anything else
But what love got to do with it when I don′t love myself
To the point I should hate everything I do love?
Should I hate living my life inside the club?
Should I hate her for watching me for that reason?
Should I hate him for telling me that I'm seizin'?
Should I hate them for telling me ""ball out""?
Should I hate street credibility I′m talkin′ about
Hating all money, power, respect in my will
Or hating the fact none of that shit make me real?

Late nights thinkin' of you
(of you)
Until I got my nut
(you know I get money)
Tossed and turned, lesson learned
You was my first girlfriend
Bridges burned, all across the board
Destroyed, but what for?
verse

Kendrick Lamar
George Clinton
Yo, what′s up? It's Dre
Remember the first time you came out to the house?
You said you wanted a spot like mine
But remember, anybody can get it
The hard part is keeping it, motherfucker
What you want you? A house or a car?
Forty acres and a mule, a piano, a guitar?
Anything, see, my name is Uncle Sam, I′m your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I know your kind (that's why I'm kind)
Don′t have receipts (oh man, that′s fine)
Pay me later, wear those gators
Cliché and say, ""Fuck your haters""
I can see the baller in you
I can see the dollar in you
Little white lies, but it's no white collar in you
But it′s whatever though because I'm still followin′ you
Because you make me live forever baby, count it all together baby
Then hit the register and make me feel better baby
Your horoscope is a gemini, two sides
So you better cop everything two times
Two coupes, two chains, two c-notes
Too much ain't enough both we know
Christmas, tell ′em what's on your wish list
Get it all, you deserve it Kendrick
And when you hit the White House, do you
But remember, you ain't pass economics in school
And everything you buy, taxes will deny
I′ll Wesley Snipe your ass before 35 (yeah)
Lookin′ down is quite a drop
(it's quite a drop, drop)
Lookin′ good when you're on top
(when you′re on top you got it)
A lot of metaphors, leavin' miracles metaphysically in a state of euphoria
Look both ways before you cross my mind

Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents

Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty

Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like my self
Every dog has it′s day, now doggy style shall help

Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion

What money got to do with it
When I don′t know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain′t proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit
Hol' up, get it back
I said I′m trapped inside the ghetto and I ain′t proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama′s rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Who ever thought?
Master take the chains off me
Life can be like a box of chocolate
Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin′, that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow′s so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you′re salmonella poison positive
I can just alleviate the rap industry politics
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
A dream′s only a dream if work don't follow it
Remind me of the homies that used to know me, now follow this
I′ll tell you my hypothesis, I'm probably just way too loyal
K Dizzle would do it for you, my niggas think I′m a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually you′re never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to the fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin′ at artists like the harvests
So many Rollies around you and you want all of them
Somebody told me you thinkin′ 'bout snatchin′ jewelry
I should've listened what my grandmama said to me

One more suck away from wavin′ flashy wrist
My defense mechanism tell me to get him, quickly because he got it
It's the recession, then why the fuck he in King of Diamonds?
No more livin′ poor, meet my .44
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they′re your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot for this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I′m on the clock once that watch landin′ in LA

Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey

If these walls could talk they′d tell me to swim good
No boat I float better than he would
No life jacket I′m not the guard in Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me? I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean its still amazing before they couldn′t stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Everytime I come around demolition might crush

Yelling at me continuously I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I′ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must′ve missed them

If your walls could talk they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them where they are
Take the recipe, the bible and god
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you′re reputable, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to ""Sing About Me""
Retaliation is strong you even dream about me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted, same night
So when you play this song rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fucking on a famous rapper
Walls could talk

I never liked you, forever despise you I don′t need you

No you ain't shit, you say you love them, I know you don′t mean it
I know you′re irresponsible, selfish, in denial, can't help it
Your trials and tribulations a burden, everyone felt it
Everyone heard it, multiple shots, corners cryin′ out
You was deserted, where was your antennas again?
Where was your presence, where was your support that you pretend?
You ain't no brother, you ain′t no disciple, you ain't no friend
A friend never leave Compton for profit or leave his best friend
Little brother, you promised you′d watch him before they shot him
Where was your antennas, on the road, bottles and bitches
You faced time the one time, that's unforgiven
You even faced time instead of a hospital visit
You should thought he would recover, well
The surgery couldn't stop the bleeding for real
Then he died, God himself will say ""you fuckin′ failed""
You ain′t try
I know your secrets nigga
Mood swings is frequent nigga
I know depression is restin' on your heart for two reasons nigga
I know you and a couple block boys ain′t been speakin' nigga
Y′all damn near beefin', I seen it and your the reason nigga
And if this bottle could talk *gulp* I cry myself to sleep
Bitch everything is your fault
Faults breakin′ to pieces, earthquakes on every weekend
Because you shook as soon as you knew confinement was needed
I know your secrets
Don't let me tell them to the world about that shit you thinkin'
And that time you *gulp* I′m bout to hurl
I′m fucked up, but I'm not as fucked up as you
You just can′t get right, I think your heart made of bullet proof
Shoulda killed yo ass a long time ago
You shoulda filled that black revolver blast a long time ago
And if those mirrors could talk it would say ""you gotta go""
And if I told your secrets

I know if I′m generous at heart, I don't need recognition
The way I′m rewarded, well, that's God's decision
I know you know that line′s for Compton School District
Just give it to the kids, don′t gossip about how it was distributed
I know how people work
I know the price of life, I'm knowin′ how much it's worth
I know what I know and I know it well not to ever forget
Until I realized I didn′t know shit
The day I came home

Waitin' for you
verse
I met a little boy that resembled my features
Nappy afro, gap in his smile
Hand-me-down sneakers bounced through the crowd
Run a number on man and woman that crossed him
Sun beamin′ on his beady beads exhausted
Tossin′ footballs with his ashy black ankles
Breakin' new laws, mama passed on home trainin′
He looked at me and said, Kendrick you do know my language
You just forgot because of what public schools had painted
Oh, I forgot, 'Don′t Kill My Vibe', that′s right, you're famous
I used to watch on Channel 5, TV was taken
But never mind you're here right now don′t you mistake it
It′s just a new trip, take a glimpse at your family's ancestor
Make a new list, of everything you thought was progress
And that was bullshit
I know your life is full of turmoil
Spoiled by fantasies of who you are, I feel bad for you
I can attempt to enlighten you without frightenin′ you
If you resist, I'll back off quick, go catch a flight or two
But if you pick destiny over rest in peace then be an advocate
Tell your homies especially to come back home
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
This is a world premiere
I been lookin for you my whole life, an appetite
For the feeling I can barely describe, where you reside?
Is it in a woman, is it in money, or mankind?
Tell me something got me losing my mind, ah!
You make me wanna jump
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
(Let′s talk about love)
(Jump, jump, jump, jump, jump)
(Let's talk about love)

Tell me something think I'm losing my mind, ah!
outro
I say where you at, from the front to the back
I′m lookin′ for you I react, only when you react
Ah, I thought I found you, back in the ghetto
When I was seventeen with the .38 Special
Maybe you're in a dollar bill, maybe you′re not real
Maybe only the wealthy get to know how you feel
Maybe I'm paranoid, ha, maybe I don′t need you anyway
Don't lie to me I′m suicidal anyday
I can be your advocate
I can preach for you if you tell me what the matter is

14 years later going hard, like we used to on the dead homies

My lil′ homie Stunna Deuce ain't never comin′ back, my nigga
So you better go hard every time you jump on wax, my nigga
Fuck what they talkin' bout, your shit is where it′s at, my nigga
Came in this game, you stuck your fangs in this game
You wore no chain in this game, your hood your name in this game
Now you double up, time to bubble up the bread and huddle up
Stickin' to the scripts, now here if them Benjamins go cuddle up
Skip, hop, drip, drop, flip, flop with the white tube sock
It goes ""Sherm Sticks, burn this""
That′s what the product smell like when the chemicals mix
50 nigga salute, out the Compton zoo, with the extras
El Co's, Monte Carlos, Road Kings and dressers
Rip Ridaz, P-Funkers, Mexicans, they fuck with you
Asians, they fuck with you, nobody can fuck with you

Hopped out the caddy, just got my dick sucked

Oh, yeah? Puto want to squabble with mi barrio?
Oh, yeah? Tell ′em they can run it for the cardio
Oh, yeah? Everything is everything, it's scandalous
Slow motion for the ambulance, the project filled with cameras
The LAPD gamblin′, scramblin', football numbers slanderin′
Niggas names on paper, you snitched all summer
Streets don't fail me now, they tell me it′s a new gang in town
From Compton to Congress, set trippin' all around
Ain't nothin′ new, but a flu of new Demo-Crips and Re-Blood-licans
Red state versus a blue state, which one you governin′?
They give us guns and drugs, call us thugs
Make it they promise to fuck with you
No condom, they fuck with you, Obama say, ""What it do?""
Obama say, ""What it do?""

Everybody want to talk about who this and who that
Who the realest and who wack, or who white or who black
Critics want to mention that they miss when hip hop was rappin'
Motherfucker, if you did, then Killer Mike′d be platinum
Y'all priorities fucked up, put energy in wrong shit
Hennessy and Crown Vic, my memory been gone since
Don′t ask me 'bout no camera blocking at award shows
No, don't ask about my bitch, no, don′t ask about my Vogues
′Less you askin' me about power, yeah, I got a lot of it
I′m the only nigga next to Snoop that can push the button
Had the Coast on standby
""K. Dot, what up? I heard they opened up Pandora's box""
I box ′em all in, by a landslide
Nah homie we too sensitive, it spill out to the streets
I make the call and get the coast involved then history repeats
But I resolved inside that private hall while sitting down with Jay
He said, ""It's funny how one verse could fuck up the game""
I been A-1 since day one, you niggas boo-boo
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
I didn′t want to self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn't stop survivors guilt
Going back and forth
Trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting a continuous war back in the city
I was entering a new one

To Pimp A Butterfly,How Much A Dollar Cost,2015,"Show performers
verse
Kendrick Lamar
How much a dollar really cost?
The question is detrimental, paralyzin′ my thoughts
Parasites in my stomach keep me with a gut feeling, y'all
Gotta see how I′m chillin' once I park this luxury car
Hopping out feeling big as Mutombo
20 on pump six, dirty Marcellus called me Dumbo
20 years ago, I can't forget
Now I can lend all my ear into how to stack these residuals tenfold
The liberal concept of what men′ll do
2006, he didn′t hear me
Indigenous African only spoke Zulu
My American tongue was slurry
Walked out the gas station
A homeless man with a semi tan complexion asked me for ten Rand
Stressin' ′bout dry land
Deep water, powder blue skies that crack open
A piece of crack that he wanted, I knew he was smokin'
He begged and pleaded
Asked me to feed him twice, I didn′t believe it
Told him, ""Beat it""
Contributin' money just for his pipe, I couldn′t see it
He said, ""My son, temptation is one thing that I've defeated""
""Listen to me, I want a single bill from you""
""Nothin' less, nothin′ more""
pre-chorus

I told him I ain′t have it, and closed my door
Tell me how much a dollar cost

verse

He′s starin' at me in disbelief
My temper is buildin′, he's starin′ at me, I grab my key
He's starin' at me, I started the car then tried to leave
And somethin′ told me to keep it in park until I could see
A reason why he was mad, a stranger like I was supposed to save him
Like I′m the reason he's homeless and askin′ me for a favor
He's starin′ at me, his eyes follow me with no laser
He's starin′ at me, I notice that his stare is contagious
'Cause now I'm starin′ back at him, feelin′ some type of disrespect
If I could throw a bat at him, it'd be aimin′ at his neck
I never understood someone beggin' for goods
Askin′ for handouts, takin' it if they could
And this particular person just had it down pat
Starin′ at me for the longest until he finally asked
""Have you ever opened to Exodus 14?""
pre-chorus
Kendrick Lamar
""A humble man is all that we ever need""
""Tell me how much a dollar cost""

verse
Kendrick Lamar
Guilt trippin' and feelin′ resentment
I never met a transient that demanded attention
They got me frustrated, indecisive and power trippin′
Sour emotions got me lookin' at the universe different
I should distance myself, I should keep it relentless
My selfishness is what got me here, who the fuck I′m kiddin'?
So I′ma tell you like I told the last bum, crumbs and pennies
I need all of mines, and I recognize this type of panhandlin' all the time
I got better judgement, I know when n—′s hustlin'
Keep in mind, when I was strugglin', I did compromise
Now I comprehend, I smell grandpa′s old medicine
Reekin′ from your skin, moonshine and gin
Nigga you're babblin′, your words ain't flatterin′, I'm imaginin′ Denzel be lookin' at O'Neal
Kazaam is sad thrills, your gimmick is mediocre, the jig is up
I seen you from a mile away losin′ focus
And I′m insensitive, and I lack empathy
He looked at me and said, ""Your potential is bittersweet""
I looked at him and said, ""Every nickel is mines to keep""
He looked at me and said, ""Know the truth, it'll set you free""
""You′re lookin' at the Messiah, the son of Jehovah, the Higher Power""
""The choir that spoke the word, the Holy Spirit, the nerve of Nazareth""
""And I′ll tell you just how much a dollar cost""
""The price of having a spot in Heaven, embrace your loss, I am God""

Keep your head up, when did you stop
Loving thy color of your skin, color of your eyes
That's the real blues, baby, like you met Jay′s baby, uh
You blew me away, you think more beauty in blue, green and grey
All my solemn men up north, 12 years a slave
12 years of age, thinkin' my shade too dark
I love myself, I no longer need Cupid
Enforcin' my dark side like a young George Lucas
Light don′t mean you smart, bein′ dark don't make you stupid
And frame of mind for them bustas, ain′t talkin' ""Woo-hah!""
Need a paradox for the pair of daughters they tutored
Like two Todds, L-L, you lose two times
If you don′t see your beautiful in your complexion
It ain't complex to put it in context
Find the air beneath the kite, uh, that′s the context
Yeah, baby, I'm conscious, ain't no contest
If you like it, I love it, all your earth tones been blessed
Ain′t no stress, jiggaboos wanna be
I ain′t talkin' Jay, mm-mm, I ain′t talkin' Bey
I′m talkin' days we got school watchin′ movie screens
And spike your self esteem the new James Bond gon' be black as me
Black as brown, hazelnut, cinnamon, black tea
And it's all beautiful to me
Call your brothers magnificent, call all the sisters queens
We all on the same team, blues and pirus, no colors ain′t a thing

You hate me, don't you?
You hate my people, your plan is to terminate my culture
You′re fuckin' evil
I want you to recognize that I′m a proud monkey
You vandalize my perception but can't take style from me
And this is more than confession
I mean I might press the button just so you know my discretion
I'm guardin′ my feelings, I know that you feel it
You sabotage my community, makin′ a killin'
You made me a killer, emancipation of a real nigga

When I finish this, if you listen, then sure you will agree
This plot is bigger than me, it′s generational hatred
It's genocism, it′s grimy, little justification
I'm African-American, I′m African
I'm Black as the heart of a fuckin' Aryan
I′m Black as the name of Tyrone and Darius, excuse my French
But fuck you, no, fuck y′all, that's as blunt as it gets
I know you hate me, don′t you?
You hate my people, I can tell 'cause it′s threats when I see you
I can tell 'cause your ways deceitful
Know I can tell because you in love with that Desert Eagle
Thinkin′ maliciously, he get a chain then you gon' bleed him
It's funny how Zulu and Xhosa might go to war
Two tribal armies that wanna build and destroy
Remind me of these Compton Crip gangs that live next door
Beefin′ with Pirus, only death settle the score
So don′t matter how much I say I like to preach with the Panthers
Or tell Georgia State, ""Marcus Garvey got all the answers""
Or try to celebrate February like it's my B-Day
Or eat watermelon, chicken, and Kool-Aid on weekdays
Or jump high enough to get Michael Jordan endorsements
Or watch BET ′cause urban support is important
So why did I weep when Trayvon Martin was in the street
When gang-banging make me kill a nigga blacker than me?
Hypocrite!

And it′s evident I'm moving at a meteor speed
Finna run into a building, lay my body-
Not on my, not while I'm up here
Not on my time, kill the music, not on my time
We could save that shit for the streets
We could save that shit, this for the kids, bro
2015, niggas tired of playin′ victim, dog
Niggas ain′t trying to play vic- TuTu, how many niggas we done lost?
How many- Yan-Yan, how many we lost?
No for real, answer the que-, how many niggas we done lost bro?
This-, this year alone
Exactly, so we- we ain't got time to waste time, my nigga
Niggas gotta make time, bro
The judge make time, you know that, the judge make time, right?
The judge make time so it ain′t shit
It shouldn't be shit for us to come out here and appreciate the little bit of life we got left, dog
On the dead homies, Charlie P, you know that, bro
You know that
It′s- it's mando, right, it′s mando
And I s- I- And I- And I say this because I love you niggas, man
I love all my niggas, bro
Exac- enough said, enough said
And we gon' get back to the show and move on, 'cause that shit petty, my nigga
Mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check, mic check
We gon′ do some acapella shit before we get back to-
All my niggas listen, listen to this
I promised Dave I′d never use the phrase ""Fuck nigga""
He said, ""Think about what you saying, ""Fuck niggas""
No better than Samuel on the Django
No better than a white man with slave boats""
Sound like I needed some soul searching
My Pops gave me some game in real person
Retraced my steps on what they never taught me
Did my homework fast before government caught me
So I'ma dedicate this one verse to Oprah
On how the infamous, sensitive N-word control us
So many artists gave her an explanation to hold us
Well, this is my explanation straight from Ethiopia
N-E-G-U-S definition: royalty, king royalty - wait, listen
N-E-G-U-S description: black emperor, king, ruler, now let me finish
The history books overlook the word and hide it
America tried to make it to a house divided
The homies don′t recognize we been using it wrong
So I'ma break it down and put my game in a song
N-E-G-U-S, say it with me, or say it no more
Black stars can come and get me
Take it from Oprah Winfrey, tell her she right on time
Kendrick Lamar, by far, realest Negus alive
"
To Pimp A Butterfly,Mortal Man,2015,"The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan (one two, one two)
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let these words be your earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that being said my nigga, let me ask this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Do you believe in me? Are you deceiving me?
Could I let you down easily, is your heart where it need to be?
Is your smile on permanent? Is your vow on lifetime?
Would you know where the sermon is if I died in this next line?
If I′m tried in a court of law, if the industry cut me off
If the government want me dead, plant cocaine in my car
Would you judge me a drug-head or see me as K. Lamar
Or question my character and degrade me on every blog
Want you to love me like Nelson, want you to hug me like Nelson
I freed you from being a slave in your mind, you're very welcome
You tell me my song is more than a song, it′s surely a blessing
But a prophet ain't a prophet til they ask you this question:
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my words be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And with that
Do you believe in me? How much you believe in her?
You think she gon' stick around if them 25 years occur?
You think he can hold you down when you down behind bars hurt?
You think y′all on common ground if you promise to be the
first? Can you be immortalised without your life being expired?
Even though you share the same blood is it worth the time?
Like who got your best interest?
Like how much are you dependent?
How clutch are the people that say they love you?
And who pretending?
How tough is your skin when they turn you in?
Do you show forgiveness?
What brush do you bend when dusting
your shoulders from being offended?
What kind of den did they put you in when the lions start hissing?
What kind of bridge did they burn?
Revenge or your mind when it′s mentioned?
You wanna love like Nelson, you wanna be like Nelson
You wanna walk in his shoes but you peacemaking seldom
You wanna be remembered that delivered the message
That considered the blessing of everyone
This your lesson for everyone, say
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
Want you look to your left and right, make sure you ask your friends
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The voice of Mandela, hope this flow stay propellin'
Let my word be your Earth and moon
You consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me, nigga
I been wrote off before, I got abandonment issues
I hold grudges like bad judges, don′t let me resent you
That's not Nelson-like, want you to love me like Nelson
I went to Robben′s Island analysing, that's where his cell is
So I could find clarity, like how much you cherish me
Is this relationship a fake or real as the heavens be?
See I got to question it all, family, friends, fans, cats, dogs
Trees, plants, grass, how the wind blow
Murphy′s Law, generation X, will I ever be your X?
Floss off a baby step, mauled by the mouth of
Pit bulls, put me under stress
Crawled under rocks, ducking y'all, it's respect
But then tomorrow, put my back against the wall
How many leaders you said you needed then left ′em for dead?
Is it Moses, is it Huey Newton or Detroit Red?
Is it Martin Luther, JFK, shoot or you assassin
Is it Jackie, is it Jesse, oh I know, it′s Michael Jackson, oh
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
That nigga gave us Billie Jean, you say he touched those kids?
When shit hit the fan, is you still a fan?
The ghost of Mandela, hope my flows they propel it
Let my word be your earth and moon you consume every message
As I lead this army make room for mistakes and depression
And if you riding with me nigga, let me ask this question nigga
""I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went running for answers
Until I came home
But that didn′t stop survivor's guilt
Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
But while my loved ones was fighting the
continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination
Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
The word was respect
Just because you wore a different gang color than mine′s
Doesn't mean I can′t respect you as a black man
Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I′m just another nigga""
Shit and that′s all I wrote
I was gonna call it Another Nigga but, it ain't really a poem,
I just felt like it′s something you probably could relate to.
Other than that, now that I finally got a chance to holla at you,
I always wanted to ask you about a certain situa--,
about a metaphor actually, you spoke on the ground.
What you mean 'bout that, what the ground represent?
The ground is gonna open up and swallow the evil
Right
That′s how I see it, my word is bond.
I see--and the ground is the symbol for the poor people,
the poor people is gonna open up this whole world and swallow up the
rich people. Cause the rich people gonna be so fat,
they gonna be so appetising, you know what I'm saying, wealthy,
appetising. The poor gonna be so poor and hungry,
you know what I′m saying it's gonna be like... there might
be some cannibalism out this mutha, they might eat the rich
Aight so let me ask you this then,
do you see yourself as somebody that's rich or
somebody that made the best of their own opportunities?
I see myself as a natural born hustler,
a true hustler in every sense of the word. I took nothin′,
I took the opportunities,
I worked at the most menial and degrading job and built myself up so
I could get it to where I owned it.
I went from having somebody manage me to me hiring the person that
works my management company.
I changed everything I realized my destiny in a matter of five years
you know what I′m saying I made myself a millionaire.
I made millions for a lot of people now it's time to make millions
for myself, you know what I′m saying.
I made millions for the record companies,
I made millions for these movie companies, now I make millions for us
And through your different avenues of success,
how would you say you managed to keep a level of sanity?
and by my faith in ""all good things come to those that stay true.
"" You know what I'm saying, and it was happening to me for a reason,
you know what I′m saying, I was noticing, shit,
I was punching the right buttons and it was happening.
So it's no problem,
you know I mean it′s a problem but I'm not
finna let them know. I'm finna go straight through
Would you consider yourself a fighter at heart or
somebody that only reacts when they back is against the wall?
Shit, I like to think that at every opportunity I′ve ever been
threatened with resistance, it′s been met with resistance.
And not only me but it goes down my family tree.
You know what I'm saying, it′s in my veins to fight back
Aight well, how long you think it take before niggas be like,
we fighting a war,
I'm fighting a war I can′t win and I wanna lay it all down
In this country a black man only have like 5 years we can exhibit
maximum strength, and that's right now while you a teenager,
while you still strong or while you still wanna lift weights,
while you still wanna shoot back.
Cause once you turn 30 it′s like they take the heart and soul out of
a man, out of a black man in this country.
And you don't wanna fight no more.
And if you don't believe me you can look around,
you don′t see no loud mouth 30-year old muthafuckas
That′s crazy, because me being one of your offspring of the legacy
you left behind I can truly tell you that there's nothing but turmoil
goin′ on so I wanted to ask you what you
think is the future for me and my generation today?
I think that niggas is tired of grabbin' shit out the stores and next
time it′s a riot there's gonna be, like, uh, bloodshed for real.
I don′t think America know that.
I think American think we was just playing and it's gonna be some
more playing but it ain't gonna be no playing. It′s gonna be murder,
you know what I′m saying, it's gonna be like Nat Turner, 1831,
up in this muthafucka. You know what I′m saying, it's gonna happen
That′s crazy man. In my opinion,
only hope that we kinda have left is music and vibrations,
lotta people don't understand how important it is.
Sometimes I be like,
get behind a mic and I don′t know what type of energy
I'mma push out, or where it comes from. Trip me out sometimes
Because the spirits, we ain't even really rappin′,
we just letting our dead homies tell stories for us
Damn
I wanted to read one last thing to you.
It′s actually something a good friend
had wrote describing my world. It says:
""The caterpillar is a prisoner to the streets that conceived it
Its only job is to eat or consume everything
around it, in order to protect itself from this mad city
While consuming its environment the
caterpillar begins to notice ways to survive
One thing it noticed is how much the
world shuns him, but praises the butterfly
The butterfly represents the talent,
the thoughtfulness, and the beauty within the caterpillar
But having a harsh outlook on life the caterpillar sees the
butterfly as weak and figures out
a way to pimp it to his own benefits
Already surrounded by this mad city the caterpillar
goes to work on the cocoon which institutionalizes him
He can no longer see past his own thoughts
He's trapped
When trapped inside these walls certain ideas take roots,
such as going home, and bringing back new concepts to this mad city
The result?
Wings begin to emerge, breaking the cycle of feeling stagnant
Finally free, the butterfly sheds light on situations that
the caterpillar never considered, ending the internal struggle
Although the butterfly and caterpillar are
completely different, they are one and the same.""
What′s your perspective on that?
Pac? Pac?
Pac?!

Oh, like a little lamb, play in your hair

No birds chirping or flying no dogs barking

In disbeliefs our beliefs reason for all this
The tallest building plummet, cracking and crumbling
The ground is shaking swallowing young woman
With a baby, daisies, and other flowers burning in destruction
The smell is disgusting the heat is unbearable
Preachers touching on boys run for cover the paranoid
Rapists and murderers hurdle alleys
Valleys and high places turn into
Das Famous screaming in agony
Atheists for suicide, planes falling out the sky
Trains jumping off the track, mothers yelling ""he′s alive""
Backpedaling christians settling for forgiveness
Evidence all around us the town is covered in fishes
Ocean water dried out, fire burning more tires out
Tabernacle and city capital turned inside out
Public bathroom, college classroom's been deserted
Another trumpet has sounded off and everyone heard it

(It's happening) no more discriminating the poor
(It's happening) no more bad bitches and real niggas
Wishing for granite gold the last taste of a lord

Thunder like number four, then I heard
""What have you did for me""
I fell to my knees, pulled out my resume
Then did it back to June 17th, 1997
My paperwork was like a receipt
I was valedictorian, I was fearful of judgment
But confident I had glory in all my past endeavors
Close my eyes pray to god that I live forever
Dark skies, fire and brimstone some of us sit home
Some of us never did wrong but still went to hell
Geez Louise I thought you said that I excel
I made To Pimp a Butterfly ′fore you told me
To use my vocals to save man-kind for you
Say I didn′t try for you, say I didn't ride for you
I tied for you, I pushed the club to the side for you
Who love you like I love you?
Crucifix, tell me you can fix
Anytime I need, I′mma start jotting everything in my diary
Never would you lie to me

A peace of mind
That′s what the Asian said, I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said, taking my time
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
(What did the Indian say?)
A piece of land
That′s what the Indian said, I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcomes and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now, what the black man say?)
A piece of pussy
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said, nigga, come back to reality for a week
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn′t be prouder, you should allow it

That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said, it don′t even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplishing, what he said to the boy
I'ma make you some promises that you just can′t ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain′t signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece

That′s what the Asian said, I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said, taking my time
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?
(What did the Indian say?)
A piece of land
That′s what the Indian said, I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcomes and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
(Now, what the black man say?)
A piece of pussy
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said, nigga, come back to reality for a week
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn′t be prouder, you should allow it
(What the white man say?)
A piece of mine′s
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said, it don′t even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
Look at what you accomplishing, what he said to the boy
I'ma make you some promises that you just can′t ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain′t signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece
chorus
I holler, ""What you do? What you say?""
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, ""What you do? What you say?""
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor
Jumped into a pit of flames and burned to coal
Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow

And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me
And that means the world to me

Somebody said you bumped your head and bled the floor

Drowned inside the lake outside, away you flow
And this I know
verse
I got 100 on my dash, got 200 in my trunk
Name in the grab bags, put my Bible in the trunk
Taaka vodka on the top of my binocular I′m drunk
How can I can make them popular, pop 'em when I want
See I′m livin' with anxiety, duckin' the sobriety
Fuckin′ up the system I ain′t fuckin' with society
Justice ain′t free, therefore justice ain't me
So I justify his name on obituary
Why you wanna see a good man wit′ a broken heart?
Once upon a time I used to go to church and talk to God
Now I'm thinkin′ to myself, ""Hollow tips is all I got""
Now I'm drinkin' by myself, at the intersection, parked
Watch you when you walk inside your house
You threw your briefcase all on the couch
I plan on creeping through your fuckin′ door and blowin′ out
Every piece of your brain 'til your son jump in your arm
Cut on the engine, then sped off in the rain
I′m gone
chorus

Drowned inside the lake, outside away you flow

And that means the world to me
verse
Drove alone, wit' a bottle of his own grippin′ the handle
Lit off henny, I'm tryna dismantle
These wicked ways, I′ve engaged in such a gamble
'Cause I could speak the truth and I know the world would unravel, wait
That's a bit ambitious, maybe I′m trippin′
Maybe I'm crazy, maybe I exist in a different dimension
Not to mention when I close my eyes, I see the distance
It′s such a scary sight so I rarely go to sleep at night
I watch the sun rise then I watch the sun fall
Studied the son of God but still don't recognize my flaws
I guess I′m lost, the cost of being successful is equal to being neglectful
I pray my experience helps you
As for me I'm tryna sort it out
Searching for loopholes in my bruised soul
But who knows?
I just need a lil′ space to breathe
I know perception is key, so I am king
The other side has never mortified my mortal mind
The borderline between insanity is father time
I fall behind my skeleton, they tell me that I'm blind
I know that I'm intelligence, my confidence just died
Carpe diem, seize the day, I can′t compromise
A tape worm couldn′t cure this gluttonous appetite
A couple trinkets, they seein' me as I pacify
But couldn′t fathom the meaning of seein' sacrifice
I′m passin' lives on a daily, maybe I′m losing faith
Genocism and capitalism just made me hate
Correctionals and these private prisons gave me a date
Professional dream killers reason why I'm awake
I'm sleepwalkin′, I′m street stalkin', I′m outta place
Reinforcing this heat barking, these are the brakes
Before I blink do I see me before them pearly gates?
Or this is just a mirage or a façade

And it's something I gotta have
Blue faces
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Blue faces
Get that new money, and it′s breaking me down honey
verse
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
And you're relating
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn't hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow

Why so sad?

My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don′t give a damn
Intuition she got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don′t prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can′t handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If yan't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain′t no money like fast money
Even today I′m considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them

Somebody yell ""Kendrick American, they sho′ is crazy""
And I said ""why?""

You're banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you′re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain't shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I paid my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y′all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you′re looking for dope
These days ain't no compromise
And your pain ain′t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain't shit to me
Bitch I made my moves, with shackled feet
Cape Town
In today′s day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes long, that's when you go wrong
You selfish motherfucker

Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin′ a walk the other day
And I seen a woman, a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin′
And havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watching her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
Hello, ma′am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it
She replied, ""Oh yes, you have lost something""
""You′ve lost your life""
Is it wickedness?

Loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA
Cocaine quarter piece, got war and peace inside my DNA
I got power, poison, pain and joy inside my DNA
I got hustle though, ambition, flow inside my DNA
I was born like this, since one like this, immaculate conception
I transform like this, perform like this, was Yeshua new weapon
I don′t contemplate, I meditate, then off your fucking head
This that put-the-kids-to-bed
This that I got, I got, I got, I got
Realness, I just kill shit 'cause it′s in my DNA
I got millions, I got riches buildin' in my DNA
I got dark, I got evil, that rot inside my DNA
I got off, I got troublesome heart inside my DNA
I just win again, then win again like Wimbledon, I serve
Yeah, that's him again, the sound that engine in is like a bird
You see fireworks and Corvette tire skrrt the boulevard
I know how you work, I know just who you are
See, you′s a, you′s a, you's a
Bitch, your hormones prolly switch inside your DNA
Problem is, all that sucker shit inside your DNA
Daddy prolly snitched, heritage inside your DNA
Backbone don′t exist, born outside a jellyfish, I gauge
See, my pedigree most definitely don't tolerate the front
Shit I′ve been through prolly offend you, this is Paula's oldest son
I know murder, conviction, burners, boosters
Burglars, ballers, dead, redemption
Scholars, fathers dead with kids and
I wish I was fed forgiveness
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, soldier′s DNA
Born inside the beast, my expertise checked out in second grade
When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate
And I′m gon′ shine like I'm supposed to, antisocial, extrovert
And excellent mean the extra work
And absentness what the fuck you heard
And pessimists never struck my nerve
And Nazareth gonna plead his case
The reason my power′s here on earth
Salute the truth, when the prophet say
bridge
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA (this is why I say that hip hop)
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA (has done more damage to young African Americans)
I live a better life, I'm rollin′ several dice, fuck your life (than racism in recent years)
I got loyalty, got royalty inside my DNA (I live a be-, fuck your life)
This is my heritage, all I'm inheritin′ (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
Money and power, the mecca of marriages

Tell me somethin'
You motherfuckers can't tell me nothin′
I′d rather die than to listen to you
My DNA not for imitation
Your DNA an abomination
This how it is when you're in the Matrix
Dodgin′ bullets, reapin' what you sow
And stackin′ up the footage, livin' on the go
And sleepin′ in a villa
Sippin' from a Grammy and walkin' in the buildin′
Diamond in the ceilin′, marble on the floors
Beach inside the window, peekin' out the window
Baby in the pool, godfather goals
Only Lord knows I′ve been goin' hammer
Dodgin′ paparazzi, freakin' through the cameras
Eat at Four Daughters, Brock wearin′ sandals
Yoga on a Monday, stretchin' to Nirvana
Watchin' all the snakes, curvin′ all the fakes
Phone never on, I don′t conversate
I don't compromise, I just penetrate
Sex, money, murder, these are the breaks
These are the times, level number 9
Look up in the sky, 10 is on the way
Sentence on the way, killings on the way
Motherfucker, I got winners on the way
You ain′t shit without a body on your belt
You ain't shit without a ticket on your plate
You ain′t sick enough to pull it on yourself
You ain't rich enough to hit the lot and skate
Tell me when destruction gonna be my fate
Gonna be your fate, gonna be our faith
Peace to the world, let it rotate
Sex, money, murder, our DNA

Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters

I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness

Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I′ll choose faith over riches
I′ll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I′ll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell ′em we ain't shit, but He′s been perfect, world

Way too hot to simmer down
Might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racin' like a junkie′s
I just need you to want me
Am I askin' too much?

Ooh, I don't want more than that
Girl, I respect the cat
I promise just a touch
Let me put the head in, if it′s okay

Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin′ hands up right now

Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin′ 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—

Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don′t go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with your homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doin', just make it count (I need some water)
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin′ ′bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the ′Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have ′em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce

I wake in the mornin′, my head spinnin' from the last night
Both in the trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life!
Manager called, the lobby called, it′s 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100k, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap and do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Lookin' for confirmation, hopin′ election wasn′t true
All of us worried, all of us buried, and our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Still and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passin′, things change
Revertin' back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
LUST
Lately, I feel like I been lustin′ over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately, lately, lately, my lust been heightened (lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction
Lately, I′m not here
Lately, I lust over self
Lust turn into fear
Lately, in James 4:4 says
Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord
Brace yourself, lust is all yours

New Kung Fu Kenny
Throw a steak off the yacht
To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
Leave him in the wilderness
With a sworn nemesis, he′ll make it
Take the gratitude from him
I bet he'll show you something, woah
I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I′ll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I′ll chip a nigga little bit of nothing
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like bitch I did that x-rated
Johnny don′t wanna go to school no more, no more
Johnny said books ain't cool no more (no more)
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin′
God bless America you know we all love him
Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin′, way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head philosphing on what the lord had done
He said, ""K-Dot can you pray for me?
It's been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome""
He was lookin′ for some closure
Hopin′ I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him
""I can't sugar coat the answer for you
This is how I feel—if somebody kill my son
That mean somebody′s gettin' killed""
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a niggas spot and watch him hit his block
I′ll catch a nigga leavin' service if that′s all I got
I'll chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch I did that""
Ain't no black power when your baby killed by a coward
I can′t even keep the peace, don′t you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma
Touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece
Touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm ′bout to speak at this convention
Call you back
Alright kids we're gonna talk about gun control

It's murder on my street, w′all street, back streets
Wall street, corporate offices, banks
Employees and bosses with homicidal thoughts
Donald Trump's in office, we lost Barack
And promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you crippin'ìg or you married to blood?
I′ll ask again—oops—accident
It′s nasty when you set us up
Then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us

verse
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin′ it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin′
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that′s holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit′ll make me flip out and just kill somethin′
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil′ somethin'
I practiced runnin′ from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say ′bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin′ fear, fear of losin′ creativity
I'm talkin′ fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I′m talkin' fear, fear of losin′ loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I′m talkin′ fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin′ fear, fear that love ain't livin′ here no more
I'm talkin′ fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within 14 tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin′ for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can′t take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within 14 tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I′m livin' through fear or livin′ through rap
Damn

Verse two says, ""You only have I known of all the families of the Earth
Therefore, I will punish you for all your iniquities""
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians, are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites according to the Bible
The children of Israel, He′s gonna punish us for our inequities
For our disobedience because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you'll chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you because He loves you
So that′s why we get chastised, that′s why we're in the position we′re in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America

Just to remind you, sweetheart

Oh, Lamar, Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I′m a star
Life is one funny mo'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty′s dialect
Adaptation inevitable, gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin′ and jokin' made life easier, hard times, Momma on crack
A four-year-old tellin′ his nanny he needed her
His family history, pimpin' and bangin′
He was meant to be dangerous
Clocked him a grip and start slangin'
15, scrapin′ up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
10,000 dollars out of a project housing, that's on the daily
Seen his first mill′ 20 years old, had a couple of babies
Had a couple of shooters
Caught a murder case, fingerprints on the gun they assumin′
But witnesses couldn't prove it
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin′
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang
That 5.0 thing, they say 5-0 came
Circlin′ parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin′ the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot
There was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth
He worked the window, his name was Ducky
He came from the streets, the Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and 500 dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he′d see college
Hustlin′ on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
′Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That′s when affiliation was really eight gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin′ us devilish works
Killin' us, crime, intelligent, felonious
Prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he′d get on these niggas′ good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line
Two extra biscuits, Anthony liked him and then let him slide
They didn't kill him, in fact, it look like they′re the last to survive
Pay attention, that one decision changed both of they lives
One curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put ′em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul so they can make their own choices and live with it
20 years later, them same strangers, you make ′em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin′ life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

verse
What is a bitch in a miniskirt?
A man in his feelings with bitter nerve
What is a woman that really hurt?
A demon, you're better off killing her
What is a relative making repetitive narratives, on how you did it first?
That is a predator, hit reverse, all of your presidents' evil thirst
What is a neighborhood rep′table?
That is a snitch on a pedestal
What is a house with a better view?
A family broken in variables
What is a rapper with jewelry?
A way that I show my maturity
What if I call on security?
That mean I′m calling on God for purity
I went and got me a therapist
I can debate on my theories and sharing it (whoa)
Consolidate all my comparisons
Humblin' up because time was imperative (whoa)
Started to feel like it′s only one answer
To everything, I don't know where it is (whoa)
Popping a bottle of Claritin (whoa)
Is it my head or my arrogance? (Whoa)
Shaking and moving, like, what am I doing?
I′m flipping my time through the Rolodex
Indulging myself and my life and my music
The world that I'm in is a cul-de-sac
The world that we in is just menacing
The demons portrayed as religious
I wake in the morning, another appointment
I hope the psychologist listenin′
chorus
The new Mercedes with black G-Wagon
The ""Where you from?"" it was all for rap
I was 28 years young, twenty mill' in tax
Bought a couple of mansions, just for practice
Five hundred in jewelry, chain was magic
Never had it in public, late reaction
50K to cousins, post a caption
Pray none of my enemies hold me captive

I grieve different
I grieve different (huh)
verse
I met her on the third night of Chicago
North America tour, my enclave
Fee-fi-fo-fum, she was a model
Dedicated to the songs I wrote and the Bible
Eyes like green penetratin' the moonlight
Hair done in a bun, energy in the room like
Big Bang for theory, God, hopin′ you hear me
Phone off the ringer, tell the world, ""I′m busy""
Fair enough, green eyes said her mother didn't care enough
Sympathize when her daddy in the chain gang
Her first brother got killed, he was 21
I was nine when they put Lamont in the grave
Heartbroken when Estelle didn′t say goodbye
Chad left his body after we Facetimed
Green eyes said you'd be okay, first tour, sex the pain away

So what, paralyzed, the county building controlled us
I bought a Rolex watch, I only wore it once
I bought infinity pools I never swimmed in
I watched Keem buy four cars in four months
You know the family dynamics on repeat
The insecurities locked down on PC
I bought a .223, nobody peace treat
You won't doo-doo me, I smell TNT
Dave got him a Porsche, so I got me a Porsche
Paid lottery for it, I ain′t want it in portions

But the money wipin' the tears away

Jumping on, ""What the hell is that?"" I gotta relax when I feel (huh, facts)
All my decendents, they come in my sleep and say I am too real (huh, facts)

Done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right

I am not for the faint of heart
My genetic build can build multi-universes, the man of God
Playin' ""Baby Shark"" with my daughter
Watchin′ for sharks outside at the same time
Life as a protective father, I′d kill for her
My son Enoch is the part two
When I expire, my children'll make higher valleys
In this present moment, I saw that through
Ask Whitney about my lust addiction
Text messaging bitches got my thumbs hurt
Set precedent for a new sacrilegion
Writer′s block for two years, nothin' moved me
Asked God to speak through me, that′s what you hearin' now
The voice of yours truly
Teleport out my own body for comfort
I don′t pass judgment, past life regressions keep me in question
Where did I come from? I don't think like I used to
No, I don't blink like I used to
Awkward stares at everybody, see the flesh of man
But still, this man compared to nobody
Yesterday, I prayed to the flowers and trees
Gratification to the powers that be
Synchronization with my energy chakras, the ghost of Dr. Sebi
Paid it forward, cleaned out my toxins, bacteria heavy
Sciatica nerve pinch, I don′t know how to feel
Like the first time I fucked a white bitch
The first time I fucked a white bitch
I was sixteen at the Palisades
Fumbling my grades, I traveled with the team
The apache life, Centennial was like
When Mrs. Baker screamed at Doughboy
Mixed that with Purple Rain
They interchanged the scenes
Happy just to be out the hood
With all the wealthy kids
Credit cards and family plans
She drove her daddy′s Benz
I found out that he was a sheriff
That was a win-win
Because he had locked up Uncle Perry
She paid her daddy's sins
Next time I fucked a white bitch
Was out in Copenhagen
Good kid, m.A.A.d city tour
I flourished on them stages
Whitney asked did I have a problem
I said, ""I might be racist""
Ancestors watchin′ me fuck was like retaliation

Silent murderer, what′s your body count? Who your sponsorship?
Objectified so many bitches, I killed their confidence (what the-)
The media′s the new religion, you killed the consciousness (what the fuck?)
Your jealousy is way too pretentious, you killed accomplishments (what the fuck?)
Niggas killed freedom of speech, everyone sensitive (what the fuck?)
If your opinion fuck 'round and leak, might as well send your will (what the-)
The industry has killed the creators, I′ll be the first to say (what the fuck?)
To each exec', ""I′m saving your children"", we can't negotiate (what the-)
I caught a couple of bodies myself, slid my community
My last Christmas toy drive in Compton handed out eulogies
Not because the rags in the park had red gradient
But because the high blood pressure flooded the caterin′
So what's the difference 'tween your life when hiding motives?
More fatalities and reality bring you closure
The noble person that goes to work and pray like they ′posed to?
Slaughter people too, your murder′s just a bit slower

verse
Kendrick Lamar
I come from a generation of home invasions
And I got daddy issues, that′s on me
Everything them four walls had taught me, made habits bury deep
That man knew a lot, but not enough to keep me past them streets
My life is a plot, twisted from directions that I can't see
Daddy issues ball across my head, told me, ""Fuck a foul""
I′m teary-eyed, wanna throw my hands, I won't think out loud
A foolish pride, if I lose again, won't go in the house
I stayed outside, laughing with my friends, they don′t know my life
Daddy issues made me learn losses, I don′t take those well
Momma said, ""That boy is exhausted,"" he said, ""Go fuck yourself
If he give up now, that's gon′ cost him, life's a bitch
You could be a bitch or step out the margin,"" I got up quick
I′m charging baskets and falling backwards, tryna keep balance
Oh, this the part where mental stability meets talent
Oh, this the part, he breaks my humility just for practice
Tactics we learned together, sore losers forever, daddy issues

verse
Kendrick Lamar
I got daddy issues, that's on me
Looking for, ""I love you"", rarely empathizing for my relief
A child that grew accustomed, jumping up when I scraped my knee
′Cause if I cried about it, he'd surely tell me not to be weak
Daddy issues, hid my emotions, never expressed myself
Men should never show feelings, being sensitive never helped
His momma died, I asked him why he going back to work so soon?
His first reply was, ""Son, that's life, and bills got no silver spoon""
Daddy issues, fuck everybody, go get your money, son
Protect yourself, trust nobody, only your momma′n′em
This made relationships seem cloudy, never attached to none
So if you took some likings around me, I might reject the love
Daddy issues kept me competitive, that's a fact, nigga
I don′t give a fuck what's the narrative, I am that nigga
When Kanye got back with Drake, I was slightly confused
Guess I′m not mature as I think, got some healing to do
Egotistic, zero-given fucks and to be specific
Need assistance with the way I was brought up
What's the difference when your heart is made of stone
And your mind is made of gold
And your tongue is made of sword, but it may weaken your soul?
My niggas ain′t got no daddy, grow up overcompensating
Learn shit 'bout being a man and disguise it as being gangsta
I love my father for telling me to take off the gloves
'Cause everything he didn′t want was everything I was
And to my partners that figured it out without a father
I salute you, may your blessings be neutral to your toddlers
It′s crucial, they can't stop us if we see the mistakes
′Til then, let's give the women a break, grown men with daddy issues

Fake innocent, fake feminist, stop pretendin'
Y′all sentiments ain't realer than what you defendin′

All of these hoes make it difficult
Session ten, breakthrough

One of these lives, I′ma make things right
With the wrongs I've done, that′s one of you now
With the Father, Son, 'til then, I fight
Rain on me, put the blame on me
Got guilt, got hurt, got shame on me
Got six magazines that's aimed at me
Done every magazine, what′s fame to me?
It′s a game to me, where the bedroom at? (And I'm tripping and falling)
Sleep, I ain′t never had affairs with that
What's fed when the hearts and the words don′t reach?
What's fair when the money don′t take things back?
It's rare when somebody take your dreams back
I care too much, wanna share too much (and I'm tripping and falling)
In my head too much, I shut down too
I ain′t there too much, I′m a complex soul
They layered me up, then broke me down
And morality's dust, I lack in trust
This time around, I trust myself (and I′m tripping and falling)
Please everybody else but myself
All else fails, I was myself
Outdone fear, outdone myself
This year, you better one yourself
Masks on the babies, mask on an opp (and I'm tripping and falling)
Wear masks in the neighborhood stores you shop
But a mask won′t hide who you are inside
Look around, the reality's carved in the lies
Wipe my ego, dodge my pride
Look myself in the mirror (and I′m tripping and falling)
Amityville, I ain't seen nothing scarier (on and on and on and on)
I fought like a Pitbull Terrier, blood I shed could fill up aquariums
Tell all my angels, ""Carry 'em"" (and I′m tripping and falling)
Every emotion been deprived, even my strong points couldn′t survive
If I didn't learn to love myself, forgive myself a hundred times, dawg

When you was at your lowest, tell me, where the hoes was at?

Your uncle ever stole from you, day after Christmas?
Seen both of those in them county jail visits
The first and the 15th, the only religion
Noodles in the microwave, shark tank, tidal wave
Grandma shootin' niggas, blood on the highway
Crosses on the dashboard, you just want a platform
I wanna take everything that I ask for
Catch me a body, I′ll put that on anybody but my mama
She showin' a pattern for certain
I think it's white panties and minimal condoms
My uncle would tell me the shit in the movies could only be magic
This year, I did 43 shows and took it all home to buy him a casket

Independent thought is like an eternal enemy
Capitalist poising as compassionates be offending me
Yeah, suck my dick with authenticity
Yeah, Tupac dead, gotta think for yourself
Yeah, heroes looking for the villains to help
I never been sophisticated, saving face

My auntie is a man now, I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinkin' Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket
Blue Air Max′s, gold chains, and curl kits
′93 Nissan wax job, the earliest, big social, big personality, vocal
Played the underground verbatim and stayed local
My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinkin', ""I want me a bad bitch when I get big""
They hug on the corner like California King
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistlin′ down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratchin' the likes from lotto, hopin′ that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six-by-nines keepin' the music up under me
My auntie is a man now
Asked my mama why my uncles don′t like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, ""Ain't no tellin'
Niggas always been jealous because he had more women
More money and more attention made more envy
Callin′ him anything but broke was less offendin′""
My auntie is a man now, I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinkin′ Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say, ""Faggot""
""Faggot, faggot, faggot"", we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it
She wasn′t gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
That's what I told my friends in second grade
She pickin′ me up from school, they stare at her in the face
They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed
We pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothin′
My auntie is a man now, what a relationship
I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit
He gave me some cash, then gave me some game
Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained
She even cut my hair at the pad, was lovin′ my fade
The first person I seen write a rap, that's when my life had changed
House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
Cameras on the microphone, all women and men know
My auntie was a man now, we cool wit′ it
The history had trickled down and made us ign'ant
My favorite cousin said he′s returnin' the favor
And followin′ my auntie with the same behavior
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
He's more confident to live his plan now (the world's gonna bring you down)
But the family in disbelief this time
Convincin′ themselves, ""He ain′t livin' discreet, he′s fine"" (world's gonna bring you down)
They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it
The Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
He built a wall so tall you couldn′t climb over
He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start jokin′ (ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
""Faggot, faggot, faggot"", we ain't know no better
Middle school kids with no filter, however
I had to be very mindful of my good cousin
I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
I mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further
Changed his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain
Livin′ his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
We didn′t talk for a while, he seemed more distant
Wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive
But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Made raw, but time changes all
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now, remember church, Easter Sunday?
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
More spiritual when these dudes were livin′ life straight
Which I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn′t see him the same
He said my cousin was goin' through some things
He promised the world we livin′ in was an act on abomination
And Demetrius was to blame
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacher man
Wonderin' if God still call you a decent man
Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Until he singled you out to prove his point, sayin'
""Demetrius is Mary-Ann now, church, his auntie is a man now"", it hurt
You the most ′cause your belief was close to his words
Forcin′ me to stand now
I said, ""Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?
The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?
I recognize the study she was taught since birth
But that don′t justify the feelings that my cousin preserved""
The buildin' was thinkin′ out loud, bad angel
That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, ""Thank you""
The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain′t know any better
Mistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different
See, I was taught words was nothin′ more than a sound
If ever they was pronounced without any intentions
The very second, you challenged the shit I was kickin′
Reminded me about a show I did out the city
That time I brung a fan on stage to rap
But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
You said, ""Kendrick, ain′t no room for contradiction
To truly understand love, switch position
""Faggot, faggot, faggot"", we can say it together
But only if you let a white girl say ""Nigga""

If he weren′t molested, I wonder if life'll fail him
I wonder if Oprah found closure
The way that she postered the hurt that a woman carries
My mother abused young
Like all of the mothers back where we from
SSI bury family members
At the repass, they servin' Popeyes chicken
What you know about Black trauma?
F&N′s kickin′ back is another genre
Tyler Perry, the face of a thousand rappers
Using violence to cover what really happen
I know somebody's listenin′
Past life regressions to know my conditions
It's based off experience
Comma for comma, my habits insensitive

Then watchin' her firstborn make a million
And both of them off the grid for forgiveness

Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers,Mother I Sober (feat. Beth Gibbons of Portishead),2022,"verse
I′m sensitive, I feel everything, I feel everybody
One man standin' on two words, heal everybody
Transformation, then reciprocation, karma must return
Heal myself, secrets that I hide, buried in these words
Death threats, ego must die, but I let it purge
Pacify, broken pieces of me, it was all a blur
Mother cried, put they hands on her, it was family ties
I heard it all, I should′ve grabbed a gun, but I was only five
I still feel it weighin' on my heart, my first tough decision
In the shadows clingin' to my soul as my only critic
Where′s my faith? Told you I was Christian, but just not today
I transformed, prayin′ to the trees, God is taking shape
My mother's mother followed me for years in her afterlife
Starin′ at me on back of some buses, I wake up at night
Loved her dearly, traded in my tears for a Range Rover
Transformation, you ain't felt grief ′til you felt it sober
chorus
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
verse
I remember lookin' in the mirror knowin′ I was gifted
Only child, me for seven years, everything for Christmas
Family ties, they accused my cousin, ""Did he touch you, Kendrick?""
Never lied, but no one believed me when I said ""He didn't""
Frozen moments, still holdin' on it, hard to trust myself
I started rhymin′, copin′ mechanisms to lift up myself
Talked to my lawyer, told me not to be so hard on myself
He has an aura, I hope to achieve, if I find some help
Congratulations, made it to be famous, still I feel uneasy
Water watchin', live my life in nature, only thing relieves me
Spirit guide whisper in my ear, tell me that she sees me
""Did he touch you?"" I said ""No"" again, still they didn′t believe me
Mother's brother said he got revenge for my mother′s face
Black and blue, the image of my queen that I can't erase
′Til this day can't look her in the eyes, pain is takin' over
Blame myself, you never felt guilt ′til you felt it sober
chorus
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
verse
I was never high, I was never drunk, never out my mind
I need control, they handed me some smoke, but still I declined
I did it sober sittin′ with myself, I went through all emotions
No dependents, except for one, let me bring you closer
Intoxicated, there's a lustful nature that I failed to mention
Insecurities that I project, sleepin′ with other women
Whitney's hurt, the purest soul I know, I found her in the kitchen
Askin′ God, ""Where did I lose myself? And can it be forgiven?""
Broke me down, she looked me in my eyes, ""Is there an addiction?""
I said ""No,"" but this time I lied, I knew that I can't fix it
Pure soul, even in her pain, know she cared for me
Gave me a number, said she recommended some therapy
I asked my momma why she didn′t believe me when I told her ""No""
I never knew she was violated in Chicago, I'm sympathetic
Told me that she feared it happened to me, for my protection
Though it never happened, she wouldn't agree
Now I′m affected, twenty years later trauma has resurfaced
Amplified as I write this song, I shiver ′cause I'm nervous
I was five, questioning myself, ′lone for many years
Nothing's wrong, just results on how them questions made me feel
I made it home, seven years of tour, chasin′ manhood
But Whitney's gone, by time you hear this song, she did all she could
All those women gave me superpowers, what I thought I lacked
I pray our children don′t inherit me and feelings I attract
A conversation not bein' addressed in Black families
The devastation, hauntin' generations and humanity
They raped our mothers, then they raped our sisters
Then they made us watch, then made us rape each other
Psychotic torture between our lives, we ain′t recovered
Still livin′ as victims in the public eyes who pledge allegiance
Every other brother has been compromised
I know the secrets, every other rapper sexually abused
I see 'em daily buryin′ they pain in chains and tattoos
So listen close before you start to pass judgment on how he move
Learn how he cope, whenever his uncle had to walk him from school
His anger grows deep in misogyny this is post-traumatic
Black families and a sodomy, today is still active
So I set free myself from all the guilt that I thought I made
So I set free my mother all the hurt that she titled shame
So I set free my cousin, chaotic for my mother's pain
I hope Hykeem made you proud ′cause you ain't die in vain
So I set free the power of Whitney, may she heal us all
So I set free our children, may good karma keep them with God
So I set free the hearts filled with hatred, keep our bodies sacred
As I set free all you abusers, this is transformation
chorus
I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself
Ooh, I wish I was somebody
Anybody but myself

You did it, I′m proud of you

I choose me
verse
The pressure′s taking over me, it's beginning to loom
Better if I spare your feelings and tell you the truth
Lately, I redirected my point of view
You won′t grow waitin' on me
I can't live in the Matrix, huh
Rather fall short of your graces, huh
This time, I won′t trade places, huh
Not about who′s right, who's wrong, huh
Evolve, the only thing known, huh
Ask me when I′m coming home, huh
Blink twice again, I'm gone

I choose me, I′m sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I′m sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I′m sorry

She woke up in the morning, for the daily news
I was so low and mourning through the family feuds
Baby, I told you a story and laid down all the rules
Still, you won′t grow waiting on me

I choose me, I′m sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I′m sorry

'Cause all of it's toxic
Girl, I′m not relevant to givin′ on profit
Personal gain off my pain, it's nonsense
Darlin′, my demons is off the leash for a moshpit
Baby, I just had a baby, you know she need me
Workin' on myself, the counselin′ is not easy
Don't you point a finger just to point a finger
′Cause critical thinkin' is a deal-breaker
Faith in one man is a ship sinking
Do yourself a favor and get a mirror that mirror grievance
Then point it at me, so the reflection can mirror freedom
She told me that she need me the most, I didn't believe her
She even called me names on the post, the world can see it
Jokes and gaslightin′
Mad at me, ′cause she didn't get my vote, she say I′m triflin'
Disregardin′ the way that I cope with my own vices
Maybe it's time to break it off
Run away from the culture to follow my heart
bridge
I realized true love′s not savin' face
But unconditional
When will you let me go?
I trust you'll find independence
If not, then all is forgiven
Sorry I didn′t save the world, my friend
I was too busy buildin′ mine again

I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I′m sorry
I choose me, I'm sorry
I choose me, I′m sorry

As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that′s been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people
verse
I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas′ll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be a will of the wheel alignment
Residue burned, missed at a inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain
Covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain
Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard, that′s culture
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil′ nephew was shot down, the culture's involved
I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin′ to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim′ll shatter those dreams, the culture
chorus
(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood
Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you
verse
I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama′s sofa was a doo-doo popper
Head tricker, walk up closer
Ain't no Photoshoppin'
Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin′ to work and sellin′ work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin′ for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
Remote location, witness protection, they gon′ hold ya
The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin′
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears full of confusion
Water in between us, another peer's been executed
History repeats again
Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
But that′s the culture, crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you′re sober
By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
That's the problem
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Dehumanize, insensitive
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I
Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I′ll meet you
In a land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya, nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin′ it culture

(I want, I want, I want, I want)
But I want you to want me too (I want, I want, I want, I want)
I want the hood to want me back (I want, I want, I want, I want)

Look what I done for you (look what I done for you)
Look what I done for you
hook
Take the drums out
verse
Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn′t perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered
Temptation and patience, everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry
But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered
Consciousness is synchronized and crystal clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues, made rules, change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin′ down the barrel of that gun
Should I feel resentful I didn′t see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence
To my brother, to my kids, I′m in Heaven
To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven
To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven
To my friends, make sure you countin′ them blessings
To my fans, make sure you make them investments
And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you, just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn′t ready to leave
But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased
I can't stress how I love y'all
I don′t need to be in flesh just to hug y′all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all
And Sam, I′ll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live all the dreams we produce
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
Look for salvation when troubles get real
′Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can′t blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won′t reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still

Miss my uncle Lil' Mane, he said that he would kill me if I didn′t make it
Now, I′m possessed by a spirit and they can't take it
He used to bump Tha Carter III, I held my Rollie chain proud
Irony, I think my hard work let Lil Wayne down
Whatever, though, call me crazy, everybody questionable
Turn me to an eskimo, I drew the line and decimals
Snoop posted ""Taylor Made,"" I prayed it was the edibles
I couldn′t believe it, it was only right for me to let it go
Won the Super Bowl, and Nas the only one congratulate me
All these niggas agitated, I'm just glad they′re showin' they faces
Quite frankly, plenty artists, but they outdated
Old-ass flows, tryna convince me that you they favorite
This is not for lyricists, I swear, it′s not the sentiments
Fuck a double entendre, I want y'all to feel this shit
Old soul, bitch, I probably built them pyramids
Ducking strays when I rap battled in the Nickersons
Where you from? Not where I'm from, we all indigenous
Against all odds, I squabbled up for them dividends
Against all odds, I showed up as a gentleman
I done lost plenty friends, 16 to be specific
Put that on my kids′ children, we gon′ see the future first
They like, ""Dot big trippin,"" I just want what I deserve
What bridge they done burnt? All of them, it's over with

Yeah, nigga, go and up your rank
Know you a god even when they say you ain't
Yeah, nigga, keep your feelings out the way

Promisin' bank transactions and even bitcoin
I never peaced it up, that shit don′t sit well with me
Before I take a truce, I'll take ′em to Hell with me
If that money got in the hands of a crash dummy
Could jeopardize my family and burden the ones who love me
Niggas mad 'cause I decided not to pretend
Y′all stay politically correct, I'ma do what I did
Ain't no sympathy here, this shit′s hilarious
It′s a lot of opinions, but no power to carry it
2025, they're still movin′ on some scary shit
Tell 'em quit they job, and pay the real niggas they severance
Don′t insult my intelligence, I'm not just for the television
Teleport to Bullis Road and dig up all my relatives
Okay, nigga, let′s settle it, these niggas been fake loyal
Since y'all pandering to choose a side, let me do it for you
Okay, fuck your hip-hop, I watched the party just die
Niggas cackling about-, while all of y'all is on trial
Niggas thought I was antisocial when I stayed inside my house
You better off to have one woman, never think tricky right now
You niggas live in denial, ay, fuck anybody empathetic to the other side, I vow
A bitch nigga love bitch niggas, they exist with them in style
Exterminate ′em right now
Make Katt Williams and them proud, the truth ′bout to get loud
New juice is out of my cup, I sober up, and knock 'em all off
Don′t let no white comedian talk about no Black woman, that's law
I know propaganda work for them, and fuck whoever that′s close to them
The niggas that coon, the niggas that being groomed, slide on both of them
You either have Cap'n Crunch and proceeded to put water in it?
Pulled over by the law, you riding dirty, so you can′t argue with 'em?
Then make it to be a star, bare your soul and put your heart up in it?

Keep all my blessings faithfully

I did it with integrity, and niggas still try hate on me
Just wait and see, more blood be spillin', it′s just paint to me
Dangerously, nothin' changed with me, still got pain in me
Flip a coin, want the shameless me or the famous me?

Que reflejan tu mirada
La noche, tú y yo
verse
Kendrick Lamar
I got this fire burnin′ in me from within
Concentrated thoughts on who I used to be, I'm sheddin′ skin
Every day, a new version of me, a third of me demented
Cemented in pain, jugglin' the pros and cons of fame
I don't know how to make friends, I′m a lonely soul
I recollect this isolation, I was four years old
Truth be told, I′ve been battlin' my soul, tryna navigate the real and fake
Cynical about the judgment day
I did past life regression last year and it fucked me up
Reincarnated on this earth for a hundred plus
Body after body, lesson after lesson
Let′s take it back to Michigan in 1947
My father kicked me out the house 'cause I wouldn′t listen to him
I didn't care about his influence, only loved what I was doin′
Gifted as a musician, I played guitar on a grand level
The most talented where I'm from, but I had to rebel
And so I'm off in the sunset, searchin′ for my place in the world
With my guitar up on my hip as the story unfurled
I found myself with a pocket full of money
And a whole lot of respect, while the record business loved me
I was head of rhythm and blues
The women that fell to they feet, so many to choose
But I manipulated power, as I lied to the masses
Died with my money, gluttony was too attractive, reincarnated
Another life had placed me as a black woman in a Chitlin′ Circuit
Seductive vocalist as the promoter hit the curtains
My voice was angelic, straight from heaven, the crowd sobbed
A musical genius what the articles emphasized
Had everything I wanted, but I couldn't escape addiction
Heroin needles had me in fetal position, restricted
Turned on my family, I went wherever cameras be
Cocaine, no private planes for my insanity
Self-indulged, discipline never been my sentiments
I needed drugs, to me, an 8-ball was like penicillin
Fuck love, my happiness was in that brown sugar
Sex and melodies gave me hope when nobody′s lookin'
My first assistant was a small-town scholar
Never did a Quaalude ′til I got myself around her
My daddy looked the other way, he saw sin in me
I died with syringes pinched in me, reincarnated
bridge
Kendrick Lamar
My present life is Kendrick Lamar
A rapper lookin' at the lyrics to keep you in awe
The only factor I respected was raisin′ the bar
My instincts sent material straight to the charts, huh
My father kicked me out the house, I finally forgive him
I'm old enough to understand the way I was livin'
Ego and pride had me lookin′ at him with resentment
I close my eyes hopin′ that I don't come off contentious
verse
Kendrick Lamar
I′m yelling, ""Father, did I finally get it right? Everything I did was selfless
I spoke freely, when the people needed me, I helped them
I didn't gloat, even told ′em, ""No,"" when the vultures came
Took control of my fleshly body when the money changed""
""Son you do well but your heart is closed
I can tell residue that linger from your past creates itself""
Father, I'm not perfect I got urges, but I hold them down
""But your pride has to die,"" okay Father show me how
""Tell me every deed that you done and what you do it for""
I kept one hundred institutions paid, ""Okay, tell me more""
I put one hundred hoods on one stage, ""Okay, tell me more""
I′m tryna push peace in LA, ""But you love war""
No, I don't, ""Oh, yes, you do,"" okay then tell me the truth
""Every individual is only a version of you
How can they forgive when there's no forgiveness in your heart?""
I could tell You where I′m goin′, ""I could tell you who you are""
You fell out of heaven 'cause you was anxious
Didn′t like authority, only searched to be heinous
Isaiah 14 was the only thing that was prevalent
My greatest music director was you
It was colors, it was pinks, it was reds, it was blues
It was harmony and motion
I sent you down to earth 'cause you was broken
Rehabilitation, not psychosis
But now we here now, centuries you manipulated man with music
Embodied you as superstars to see how you movin′
You came a long way from garnishin' evil-ish views
And all I ever wanted from You was love and approval
I learned a lot, no more puttin′ these people in fear
The more that word is diminished, the more it's not real
The more light that I can capture, the more I can feel
I'm usin′ words for inspiration as an ideal
""So, can you promise that you won′t take your gifts for granted?""
I promise that I'll use my gifts to bring understandin′
""For every man, woman and child, how much can you vow?""
I vow my life just to live one in harmony now
""You crushed a lot of people, keepin' their thoughts in captivity""
And I′m ashamed that I ever created that enemy
""Then let's rejoice where we at""
I rewrote the devil′s story just to take our power back, 'carnated

Punch played Phil Jackson in my early practices
Strategies on how to be great amongst the averages

Rep pushed the label the same, amongst the savages
Moose kept my name in the function that he would run in
TEEZ kept the vultures away from me that was comin′
Sounwave let me borrow his clothes for shows as a hype man
To cook up in this room 'til the night ends
Time flies, I′m carryin' debates of a top five
Buryin' my opps and allies
But I′d done a half job communicatin′ feelings of bein' stagnant
Life was gettin′ bigger than just rappin'
The business, what I was lackin′
Top used to record me back when it was poor me
And now we at the round table for what assures me
I guess my motivation was the yearnin' for independence
Poured everything I had left in the family business
Now it′s about Kendrick, I wanna evolve, place my skillset as a Black exec'
I jog my memory, knowin' Black Hippy didn′t work ′cause of me
Creatively, I moved on, with new concepts in reach
Top, remember all them sessions we would strategize?
To hit the streets, then come back record three records, ah
To tell the truth, it fucked me up when D-Man passed
The motive was the condolences, but the pride crashed
I had to bypass old mythologies, I had
Put my heart on display like it was an iMac
To all my young niggas, let me be the demonstration
How to conduct differences with a healthy conversation
If that's your family, then handle it as such
Don′t let the socials gas you up, or let emotions be your crutch
Pick up the phone and bust it up before the history is lost
Hand-to-handshake is good when you have a heart-to-heart

Have you ever had to flip your unemployment?
On the dead guys, nigga, I ain′t goin'
verse
Peysoh
Ay, on the dead ones
We′ll treat an enemigo like some bread crumbs
All of my killers on go, like, who said somethin'?
Redrum, all I think about when I see heads come
Do my dance, hit the chop when I see opps go
Let ′em claim it, we the ones who really pop, bro
Don't televise it, we the ones who lettin' chops blow
Opps know, let ′em piss him off and it′s a flop show
Murder man, singin' murder music off a murder van
Beat the pussy up like I been celibate and I murder sound
Who is him? One and only shotta, known as murder man
Catch you doin′ dirty, it's no other way but murder plans
I broke her heart and you the type to go and fix it
Don′t wanna speak if you ain't talkin′ 'bout no ticket
I'm bougie wit′ it, but I might just let you kiss it
Hit that block with diamonds on me, you could tell young Peysoh did it
chorus
Kendrick Lamar & Peysoh
Kendrick Lamar
Tell ′em Peysoh did it, ay, who showed you how to run a blitz?
Tell 'em Peysoh did it, who put the West back in front of shit?
Tell ′em Peysoh did it, ay, I'm trippin′, and I'm lovin′ it
Tell 'em Peysoh did it, like, wha-
Hi, have you ever been a joint and you know it?
Have you ever had to flip your unemployment?
On the dead guys, nigga, I ain't goin′

Hitta J3
Kendrick Lamar
Hop out suicide doors, it′s the Hitta, man
You don't wanna see them doors slidin′ on the Caravan
I know killers who was catchin' bodies and not one fade
I was 13 up at Avalon, poppin′ chains
14, ridin' minibikes with some dead friends
21, flag on my head like a Taliban
25, feelin′ like the box, it was full of sand
At the cemetery, fuck that, that's where I coulda been
142nd, I'm connected like I′m Rosecrans
Kinda shit I seen, try and forget and I will pop a Xan′
Uppin' scores, doin′ files, sacrifices like a boxin' ring
Can′t throw in the towel, pistol-packin' since a child
Ay, like it′s Iraq, shoot and aim
Hussein, ridin' with the dirty blicky, switchy, make a new flame
She said I been a dawg all my life, bae, can you change?
True to my religion, Cuban links, more than two chains
chorus
Hitta J3 & Kendrick Lamar
Tell 'em Hitta did it, ay, who showed you how to run a blitz?
Tell ′em Hitta did it, who put the West back in front of shit?
Tell ′em Hitta did it, ay, I'm trippin′, and I'm lovin′ it
verse
YoungThreat
It's gettin′ down to the wire
Get on my Bob the Builder shit, get down with the pliers
Been comin' back-to-back hits, how this nigga ain't tired?
I′m with some rockstar bitches, they want Lizzy McGuire
I′m switchin' gears, I pop the clutch, I′ll send a nigga up
A risk-taker, I'll call you niggas′ bluff
If they hangin' out for real, we come deduct, tuckin′ tails, they outta luck
When it's wartime, they hidin' in the cut
Y′all had y′all chance, y'all couldn′t do it
I swear I'm comin′ worse than y'all baby moms, I′m puttin' niggas through it
They hate to see me doin' it, meal ticket, I′m pursuin′ it
I'm in the field for real, UCLA Bruins
They askin′ how I do it, how a young nigga so fluent
I kept my mouth closed, and I ain't never leave no witness
D.O.A. up on the scene, tell ′em YoungThreat did it, nigga

verse
Me and my bitch got a complicated relationship
She′s so controllin', I noticed it ain′t no playin' with
I met her when I was off the porch as a teenager
She said one day I would right my wrongs and see paper
We started out young, lookin' for some identity
Made a thousand mistakes, but never did we lack chemistry
Wrappin′ my hand ′round your waist
That was back when you did whatever I say
Dreams of sellin' narcotics, runnin′ blocks, or robbin' banks
I was in love with you, didn′t know what it was with you
Kiss you in back of the class just to get a buzz with you
Some niggas wanted you, but they weren't committed
Preoccupied playin′ John Madden and bullshittin'
Remember when granny died? You looked at me and said
""Baby, dry your eyes, depend on me as your relief
Let your anger be mine,"" we was locked in ever since then
So territorial, even took me 'way from my friends, hm, hm
chorus
Scared of forever, you know nothin′ else is gon′ pass
I just gotta let you know, woah
Whenever you want me, you got me 'til the end of time
Ooh, just gotta let you know
verse
Said you gon′ see other people if I didn't grow with you
Wasn′t no more holdin' them pistols in front of stores with you
You want reality, not tragedy, for sure, I get you
To tell the truth, I been pretty used to what open-minded people do
In 2014, I went to Africa, baby, you was my passenger
My eyes and ears for all the years the neighborhood had baffled us
Of course I had to wrap it up, I didn′t fully trust you
Fabrication, I disgust you, then you blocked me, I said, ""Fuck you""
bridge
Nigga, what? I gave you life
I breathe the motherfuckin' charisma in this bitch
I bring the blessings, I gave you power
Nigga, I bring the rainfall, I gave you hustle
Then fall right back and love the very moment that I touch you
chorus
Scared of forever, you know nothin' else is gon′ pass
I just gotta let you know
Whenever you want me, you got me ′til the end of time
Ooh, just gotta let you know
verse
You were spontaneous, firecracker, plus our love is dangerous
Life of passion, laughin' at you lose your temper, slightly crashin′
Dumb enough to ill reaction, ain't no disrespect
Highly sensitive, possess, so protect you, even when it′s tragic
So jealous, hate it when I hit the club to get some bitches
Wrote 'em off, rather see me hit the church and get religious
Who you foolin′? I know what you doin', you my contradiction
'Member when you caught that body and still wiggled through that sentence?
Loved you more, when you flip and lose your shit, I hugged you more
It′s sexy to me, cuss they ass out and hold that grudge some more
Down bitch, I know your favorite movie, is it Notebook?
So good, if they all sub me, get ′em all booked
My baby boo, you either heal niggas or you kill niggas
Both is true, it take some tough skin just to deal with you
Logical explanation don't exist, flippin′ pages
Chapter after chapter, probably remarry and head to Vegas
bridge
Bitches gettin' marked out, they can′t erase our history
They margins ain't big enough, they all led by bigotry
My woman and my right hand, my saint and my sin
Ain′t no bitch like my bitch, 'cause that bitch been my pen
chorus
Gloria, I wanna take you to euphoria
Bitches want you, but they ain't strong enough
I heard her talkin′ we notorious
It′s so much, I can only
outro
I see you, you see me
Both see what we want, oh, oh
I see you, you see me
Both see what we want
