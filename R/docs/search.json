    "text": "The data for this mini project was taken from the openFDA API. This API serves public data from the Food and Drug Administration about drugs, devices, and foods. It only has publicly available data, so there are no sensitive personal details. We hope to use this data to show a correlation between demographic information and certain adverse effects. We also want to see if some drugs are more likely to cause serious side effects compared to other drugs, and what reactions are most common.\nThus, we decided to scrape reports about adverse drug effects on patients, and filter to only include instances where the patient had severe side effects (Death, life threatening condition, hospitalization, etc). Each report has a unique report ID, details about the patients age and sex, what drug they used, how serious the side effects were, and what their reaction to the drug was. We can group the data by age group, sex, medication name, and create plots to show the size of each group and see if there is a causal relationship between 2 or more of the variables.\n\n\nCode\nkey &lt;- readLines(\"api_token\") # get key"

In both plots, we can see that the distribution is relatively even among the drugs, as it seems that most of them only occur one or two times. Lipitor stands out as having the most incidents, and we can see that it also has one death associated with it in the second plot. This plot also reveals that Glivec, while it had appeared benign before, actually caused the highest number of deaths in the data.\n\n\nCode\ndrugs |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(patientAge) & patientAge &lt; 100) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = patientAge)) +\n    geom_density(fill = \"lavender\", color = \"darkblue\", size = 1) + \n    theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most common age for incidents in the data set is in the sixties. However, this plot also highlights that some of the drugs affected children."

The prevalence for each state is calculated by averaging the percentage across its counties; by splitting the states into two categories, it becomes extremely clear that the Southeast as a geographical region has a higher prevalence of lack of sleep. This does not seem to follow the trends observed in the map of depression; however, it would be premature to assume that sleep deprivation and depression are not correlated, as there could be many other factors contributing to the trends observed in these maps."
