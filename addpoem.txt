The clock struck 12 in some reality past,
but due to inflation the witching hour is 
now two:
a for alcatraz, my mind is a prison,
and here he slides
into stomachs and other vessels:
The Ghost of Sadness yet to come.

Think on that, my dearest!
We are static, crackling through time,
and the future is a fallacy,
a logical incoherency,
until Mercury holds hands with Saturn,
grabs melancholy by the rings
and drags it sunwards to burn
into carbonic form an effigy,
a crucifixion upon which we pierce
our dreams with nails and stab
them until every one of these,
our children, sings.

Now that monolith peels its skin
into sailboats, this ethereal creature
decked with rudder and fins
pours into every orifice, ripples down
through lung, through sin, 
through my hateful past
and pathetic present.
The horror comes from watching it happen
--having given up at this point--
quite outside of my control,
quivering in nauseating catharsis,
garbanzo bean.
