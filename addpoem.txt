<u>Translation</u>
Is she diluted
     like a ball of krill
that, beneath my slamming flukes,
     scatters into your immensity?

     Has she been swept away
on a warmer current,
     or does your heart hold
traces of Unaizah forever?

I am returned echoes
     of what I sang to her then.
No lanky, thin-nosed marlin,
     she is solid even as she turns

     to expose a sunlit horizon,
silhouetted by her belly’s curve,
     that promises languorous seas
with each inertial twist.

Her mouth gape increases
     by expansion of her chasmic grooves,
where Leviathan hunts
     his scowling oarfish prey,

     and I hope 
she will swallow me,
     a floundering anchovy
drowning in her bulk.

Her flukes swing away, 
     each a fat mola in width,
though its antithesis
     in grace.

     My song could not warm
her heart, brumated as it was
     in this antarctic sea,
but it left a fair impression;

in the channel of Mozambique,
     where the warm, southward current
wafts good food and pleasure,
     my song and I returned to her.

     No libidinous bottlenose
has understood what we did,
     lingering there for days,
playing like unweaned calves,

a horror
     upon all the schools of mackerel,
shimmering, flighty,
     a new precedent for all hunters there,

     then traveling as one,
a single monarch
     to rule the coast of Africa,
from Madagascar to the Arabian Sea.

But there,
     in the mouth of Aden,
she was gone,
     like the water’s ceiling

     where, without a click,
the airy deep tightens itself
     beneath the weighty sky
and disappears.
<hr>You hold her still,
     and another—
O pitiful Huráyra!
     Here she turned from me as well,

     young, with newborn calf,
yet a tender, careful mother,
     not cynical, nor disillusioned,
not yet,

and, perceiving thus,
     many a brazen, lusty bull
battled me for love
     in the Gulf of Oman.

     Let the scars on my flank
reveal to you
     how I approach a rival without care,
phlegmatic to his postured threats,

not bending to
     a frantic fluke-slap or sullen headbutt,
neither his desperate groans,
     but accumulating his grief,

     how I wait and gash,
finally, filling the sea
     with a premature but vibrant 
vermillion sunset;

how the resident barnacles
     have riven blubber and grown fat,
feeding on our murky blood
     ‘til he flounders nigh, utterly lost,

     his body a crimson beacon
to be bitten by carrion’s gnawing teeth,
     while my skin remains a palimpsest,
selachian, of hurt.

A thousand pleasant victories
     will not be worth a single loss:
incommensurable
     is death's final click;

     as an iced harpoon that pricks beneath 
the fattest blanket,
     filling my heart with snow
and frozen slush,

the knowledge pierced me here,
     colder than water
in Winter’s solid grip,
     which desiccates moisture itself.

     The Killers,
chiaroscuro abominations,
     approached for the flesh of the calf,
all aligned in formation

for their assault, writhing,
     riling the sea from quiescence,
weight on weight
     now sounding down on us,

     dragging the babe by fin and fluke—
if I bat one away
     two more would buoy up—
I could not swallow them all;

in one eye I saw him pulled away
     tongue-torn, songless, 
he let me know
     his fear through gaze alone;

     in the other his mother’s love
beached, turned bleak as sand,
     dried up,
ruin reflected back at me.
<hr>By the sun and its brilliance,
     and the moon as it chases it,
by the morning which reveals it,
     and the twilight as it engulfs it,

     no gentle Minke nor tiny seal,
plumped upon its berg,
     has since felt death’s jaw on fin nor flipper
whilst I was swimming near;

by the somnambulistic void around,
     I swear to you,
I will drive the killer off wherever I find her
     until only I can glut her greedy hunger.

     They live for death and chatter,
the bodies of others
     are their toys,
and they do not know quietness;

if one drifts away from the pack, finding itself 
     alone in silence,
you will always see him scurry back,
     evil, but still God-fearing.
<hr>Demon in a whale’s form,
     he cannot know you,
on whom, with reverent joy and piety,
     I bring the issue to a close.

     O emptiness! O quietness!
O nothing! O listener eterne! 
     in one who holds all past regress and present tense
I lie sinking,

my codas lie thick’ning
     in your shadow, dusky blue penumbra,
memory lies sweet’ning
     on a terraced towering moonbeam,

     all suspended for a life
on your sacred, softly winking eyelid,
     catching glimpses of another,
of a seagull’s frenzied pallor,

until the day
     we all drift into void
and become as one,
     as nothing.
