i sunk into My childhood floor and pondered at the size
of a big brown boot made to house the foot of a man
i did not know. There was no sole i recognized,
revealed, outlined in toe, and only some phantasmal land
could house a giant so.

i sat there slowly shrinking down past pride, past strength, past you;
swallowed up in shoes and Giant’s maw as he had turned me into stew–
torn limb from limb, Odysseus’ kin, my flesh turned to a bile,
and shrinking, shrinking, beyond Neuron I overcame denial.
