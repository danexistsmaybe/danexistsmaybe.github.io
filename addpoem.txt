    Infinity: to sacrifice a son,
to chase Leviathan through Elmo’s Fire
  or feast upon the goat’s ungodly lyre,
to feel it all: to feel Clarissa's fun;
    or maybe held inside a crawdad's claw
and caught, somehow, in paradox, 
   inside the frigid water’s ancient rocks
I sit, I dream, I am the stream, I feel the awe…

  Yet you come here and bind me to big-O,
    Make Dijkstra seem a lapidated boot,
with programmed-static—a phylactic—attitude;
  your Linked In stare informs me of your woe,
    so I prioritize, pan-recompute,
constrained within your breadth-first finitude.
