<span class="poemtitle">Sonnet 5: Limerence Subliminal</span>
<span class="poemtext">In darkness glows a cashmere candle wick’d
called Limerence in Void; to reach for light
in such is folly’s peak, yet to not blight
my honor and her mind, absurdity I must depict.
Intending all is all that I intend
and still, no teleology could tell
the end and still, I work my purpose fell,
to contradict All That I Comprehend.

Her Beauty fills all of perfection’s scope,
and so Audacity demands transfer,
to give Devotion’s all in peace to Hope:
for keeping My Despair apart from Her;
so as to hold all evil to Her unevoked;
to see me mine—it would, I think, regret incur.</span>

<span class="poemtitle">Sonnet 4: Colors</span>
<span class="poemtext">Do you see colors in this song?
The amethyst that showed us how?—
when purple-astral rivers flowed along
a dusty constellation; rending now.
Vermillion, dandelion, rust?
The colors that I left behind
on finding I’ve been thrust
into another man’s soft mind.

Or white? Adularescent light,
superposition of a girl 
with pomegranate cheeks behind her veil;
or cerulean grey? More grey at night,
when spikes swing in and blood’s a’flurl
inside the Iron Maiden’s jail.</span>

<span class="poemtitle">Sonnet 3: Men’s Needs</span>
<span class="poemtext">Beneath the rose bowl, madness rose and all
a’gurgle bubbled pale and pink, the blood
not of performance, tickled palm, but mauled
intestine—only twins have understood.

In the abyss (where anger should have been)
are laws of love, which History’s dancers bend.
The Quietness and Emptiness had seen 
its work before; another kind of frenz’d
extravagance, another morning cracked
with dawn’s economy, a fixed sun-bleed.
Subliminal to him who beat, attacked
all not subdued nor deified: Men’s Needs.

The Kathakali Men go home to beat their wives.
Even Kunti, the soft one with breasts.</span>

<span class="poemtitle">Sonnet 2: Blood</span>
<span class="poemtext">Imagine blood in laminar flow; beautiful no?
but not real—a bad show of real blood behavior
because caked blood is cankered—but still, savor
what seeps, creeps and drips twixt heel and toe.
And think! the blood arrives to cover up the bruise—
ugly purple, unlike the shoes (brilliant purple)—
to fill in the skin like Earth's plates all a’crumple,
I mean really, which would you rather choose?

When pulverizing force leaves fragments calcium
and ruptured splintered skin, wet strips of flesh
hung reaching for a limb, a ‘pendage pulped,
and trails of gore and gastro-gut hung from
the cavern torn, and odious hanging stench!
then I'll be glad for blood and all its greedy gulps.</span>

<span class="poemtitle">Sonnet 1: How Could I Touch Anything Else?</span>
<span class="poemtext">To be I am means fragile tissue must
take on forms or forget to shatter in the pane,
so restlessly I change to slight the stain
though swallowtail eyes be filled with dust.
A glaring light shines shadows on your back,
blinded lunar ice ripples on a moonlit spine,
so real it chills this rosy heart of mine; 
how could I touch anything else?

But now, embracing narrow shoulders I
must disgrace, displace myself a few degrees,
ignite beyond blue velvet splayed unchaste
o’er boulder ‘gealed and brazen thigh,
like Sisyphus but as Eurydice’s,
your lullaby body leaves me to waste.</span>
